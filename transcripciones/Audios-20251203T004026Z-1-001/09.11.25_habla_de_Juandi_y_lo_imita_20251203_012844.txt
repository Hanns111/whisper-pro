 L央. I'm going to make that double-finger, okay? I'm so sorry. And then I have to accept to live with a family who lies. What will be the next time? He will lie at the same time. Now last week, I don't attend this unit, but... And you believe? Last. Give me an explanation. Who did it then? Listen, I don't know. But I am going to pay for the fixed part, okay? Please. Because it's a form to be careful with your house. And to let me know how much I have to pay, and I'm going to do that, please. I don't want to fight. You don't understand. I understand what are you feeling, how do you feel? And I open to pay this, please. Please accept that. You think it's just putting money into the air. You can't buy this material. This here is about something completely different, Claudia. If one person can do that, what is this person going to do? Next and next and next and next. Yeah, I understand. You point, I'm going to talk again with the voice. Okay? I know that he is lying. You talking about one there? Yes. Well, Lars, I feel that it's not only because you think that you were talking a few minutes ago that you don't lie, how he eats. Of course not. That's not normal. He is trying to do his best, but sometimes I feel that you don't feel comfortable near to him. This is, I feel that how you... I am not used to living in a house with screaming and shouting and spittacle every day. When I want to sleep on the sofa, I can't because there is someone sitting here. No. No? Yes, he speaks alone and I go and I say, please try to not down to your voice. But he has a condition. I know that. And maybe this is not my life, Claudia. But Lars. Why should I be put on this life, to put in this misery? Why? Because now we are a family and when you know me and we fully love. You promised me many things. We have a project of life and now. You are all protecting your children. You are not learning them anything. You are not developing them. And I know the feminist excites of all this bullshit and I don't care about it. You are completely exactly the same as all the other. You protect your children and you want to fight with the man because you... I know exactly how it is. Lars, they are glowing. They are... They are... They are... They are... They are like five years old. They... I... We are... You are twenty years behind. We are... We are knowing the system. They are going to enter on the system soon. They are now in the system studying. Next year, he has to do another activity this more time. And Jose Carlos too. Please Lars. Please be a little patient. And to him my best, we are a family. Please. This is one big nightmare, Claudia. That's the only thing it is. I can't even go to my own toilet. I don't know what I am going to sit on. There is peace on the floor. It's disgusting. It's not peace on the floor when he calls... Yeah, you have to clean every three seconds. No, he... What he's having and the water goes down to the floor, but it's not peace. But what is the water around the toilet? No, because he was... In the toilet? No, no, no. He... He was with a piece of paper. And he cleaned his hands. And sometimes he cleaned again. With paper? No, exactly. I am not going to pay for 500 toilets rolls in the month, Claudia. No, no, no. You can pay for the toilet. You can pay for the toothpaste. You can use as much as you want. This is not normal. And you think I would... My bag is already totally destroyed. And I have to work to earn a little money. And then you spend a lot of money off wasting. No, I am paying that. With my... Yes, I am paying. But what about learning the reality to the people instead? Yes. That is not going to happen. It's a little... A little what? Hard to learn... No. A person to teach when you have a disability. Please, this is only that. I know to make a...
