 Hmm. You didn't say anything when I told you this in the toilet. Can you repeat? I what? You didn't say anything when I showed you the happening in the toilet. Okay. I listen to you. I listen to you. But you have nothing to say? I'm something is happening. We need to fix the wall. Do you believe that it's one of my boys? So, I am... What do you believe? You don't believe it's one of your boys. I don't want to get a discussion, Lars. No, but I have a question. I want to give solutions. Yes, and I ask you a question. You don't believe it's one of your boys? I believe that I talk with them. And they say no? Yes. Both? Both. And you believe in that? Yes, why not? Now I have two pictures with evidence. And there's no other people here in this house. And you believe the boys? Yes, but you have two pictures of... Okay. But you have an opinion about them. So, I don't want to discuss with you. If you consider that was a day, I don't want to get a discussion. I know who it is and you know it too. No, I don't. So, you don't believe it's one of the boys? Yes, I don't want to get a discussion with you. I want to get a solution. If you feel that we were, please, we are ready to... Let me know how we have to pay for fix this part of the wall. I don't want to get a discussion. So, you don't? I don't want to get a discussion. I don't ask you... It is on the egg. And you know it. Lars, I want to tell you something. When I got never, never used to lie. When he used to do something, he said when he got a mistake. But you are a firm, something. Who has been in this house the last two days? All. Yes. Do you think I destroyed my own house? Lars, I am not saying nothing and I am not blaming you about... Blame me for... No, I am not saying that you have the fork in any moment. I say that. Okay, please. We are quite. I just finished the dinner, please. But please, we are in a situation now that no one did it. I am saying that I accept the work of the world. It's falling down off its own without anyone touching. I accept that of the possibility. But the problem we discussed at one time and the problem is continuing. And you still believe, don't believe. Lars, we had a big problem the last night. When you were talking about this, I was a problem. And I sure that any in the house wants to get a problem. No, but it continues. Yes, but... The same person did it again. I accept to pay for that. Okay? To fix this. That's all. That's all, since my... So you think it's okay that they continue? I don't want to have a fight. No, but I don't want this to continue happening. No, it's not going to continue. No, it's happening two times. Yes, but I don't know what is happening. You don't know what's happening. No, I don't know. You don't want that I accept something that I can't accept. Because I talk with my boss, boys, and they say that they didn't. I told you today, don't call him about this because I know it's not him. I talk with boss. Yes. I talk with boss. But you are not reasonable, Claudia. I am trying to be reasonable. But you are not? Lars, I am accepting that I'm going to pay. It's not about... It's not about that, Claudia. Yes, it's about that you... Okay, you are sure that you are saying with your finger that is on the end. It is? Okay, you say this. Yes. Okay. So you are saying that we are only four people in this house. Yes, but this is not an evidence. So who is it then? Lars, I don't want to fight. No, but I don't want to be in this nonsense. Lars, I don't want to fight. No, but I don't want my house more destroyed. But... But you don't care. No one cares. It's a poor care. And now you lie. They lie and you don't believe. She doesn't lie. He don't lie? No. So who did it? Lars. No, I want questions now. I don't know. Who did it? I don't know Lars. Okay. And you believe it's not him? Lars, okay. And... This is two questions, Claudia. Lars, please, what do you... Um... This is two questions, Claudia. I can't accept this here. I can accept too. Good. Then we stop. Yeah. You have to find another place to live, Claudia. What? You have to find another place to live. What do you see, Lars? You can't accept it. I can't accept it. Lars, please. I don't know what is happening. I know. What? You can't accept, I can't accept. No, Lars. This is not fair. You... Not fair. You say me that we have to try to find another place where to live. Are you listening? What are you saying? Are you listening? What you are telling me? I say that I accept that pay for this. It's not about paying, Claudia. Yeah. It's about admitting that someone is destroying this house. And they live on a lie and you believe them. No, Lars. You make me feel bad, Lars, because you know that... You make me feel bad. Lars, I haven't worked to live here. And you know what is my situation? Yeah, and my situation too. Claudia. I don't understand what is happening. No. But we talked about this before, Claudia. Lars. Okay. If I accept that he is... It's not about accepting that you don't understand. You don't want to... Now, Claudia, this is not a life for me. It is not... It is not a life for me, Claudia. What are you expecting about? I am trying to do all... Like your wife, I am doing all the things. I don't understand what is happening. It is not about doing things, Claudia. I am so stressed about this life. I am mentally... But you don't care. Nobody cares about me. Of course I am doing all the things here. I am cleaning and cooking my English in your clothes. I am doing all the things here. How many is in this family? Four. Yes. Who come with three? Lars, please. I don't want to buy. No. I say you as a beginning, please. I understand that you have problems with your economy now. And I accept when you say that I have to pay for the food. And I was... You say that I have to pay with my credit card. And I am doing... I am happy in the school. But we are running in... Claudia, we are not happy. We are running in chaos from the morning to the evening. If I don't... If I never do nothing... It's not about do, Claudia. They are in the school. They are not here. For example, you say now that you can't rest. But I was watching a movie with my boys in the Jose Carlos room. And anybody was doing anything noisy. We were sitting. You are not having the reality that I have Claudia. You are not feeling the reality that I feel. This is not a life for me, Claudia. And why you don't think about this when you know me. When you say that you was falling in love with me. Why you lied to me? Because I come here to this country because I am falling in love with you. Because I love you. And you speak me. If you don't care about my feelings. It's not about that, Claudia. Maybe you are talking with another person. Tell me the truth. Because I feel that you don't love me. I don't know because I do I use your behavior with me. What I live all, and I am here with my boys. They are having the school, they are having a life here. Not only about you, Claudia. It's not all about you. It's about you. It's a combination of all Claudia. I have never been so... Sometimes you say that you want to die. That you want to... That's why I have to do something, Claudia. But to make me feel what when you say this. I am nervous because I don't know if maybe I am doing something wrong. And I don't understand. No. We can't talk, we can't do, we can't act, we can't speak about who did what. No one wants to admit. We can't do nothing, we can't go a trip, we have no joy, we have no money, we have no possibilities. We cannot speak together, we are not the same. You come from a government work, I come from another world of freedom. And we are not... And you... You of course... Of course, you love your voice. Of course you do that. But when you say I can sleep in the coach and I can have my time, you don't hear the reality that I hear. Big noise and stress for me is like... Canvas. But you don't know how it is to be me. You don't hear the things, what's going on? I did not. There are also we are not animals, we are not objects. I don't say that, Claudia. But I didn't say that. I am not an object that you can say today. I want to, in the next day, I don't want you. You can't go out from here. It's not about one cloud, it's about that if we look on the reality's cloud, yeah. We are not animals. I didn't say that. But you will hear your words. You have to go to other place. What is your... One more. I can't say nothing. Why did you expect about me? I don't expect anything, Claudia. It's just been more than I can. I didn't know how this was, Claudia. What about us? I don't know, Claudia. I don't know, but I don't feel comfortable, Claudia. I'm not happy. I can't support this economy. I'm getting... I don't feel very Claudia. I don't feel well. I... And from the start, I had to explain. Explain. Explain. Explain. And we have a lot of chaos. What the fuck? We are wrong with you, Claudia. What do you say that Lars? Okay. We couldn't even go into the garden. We could do... And we still can't do nothing. Lars, this is not true.
