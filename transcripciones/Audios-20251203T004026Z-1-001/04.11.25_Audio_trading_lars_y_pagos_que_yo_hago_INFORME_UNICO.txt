B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] It's always easy to say after.
[00:05] You should have done
[00:08] like this. You should have done like this.
[00:12] You forgot to do this.
[00:21] That is exactly what is to be a human.
[00:30] We were very, very, very, very unlucky yesterday.
[00:40] If we were not unlucky, just this one time yesterday.
[00:47] Yes.
[00:50] We didn't have this speculation we have no clue.
[00:57] We will feel safe with the things we did.
[01:04] Because we put the money away.
[01:09] 33% of the money are safety.
[01:14] We continue investing.
[01:18] The investing was growing. We have safety.
[01:22] We have a future.
[01:27] I understand how you feel.
[01:31] It's not about feelings. This is about reality, Slovenia.
[01:36] Let's close your eyes and say this one trade yesterday was not happening.
[01:42] Yesterday, after that day, it was finished.
[01:46] I am sure that I will have taken some of the money to put in the electronic money.
[01:52] And they are not able to lose.
[01:56] Then the next day, we could have the possibility to look too loose or maybe.
[02:01] Maybe.
[02:05] But we still have the money there.
[02:08] But the reality is all of it.
[02:11] I know.
[02:13] That's why I say we were very, very, very unlucky.
[02:20] Do you know what means unlucky?
[02:24] It's the same as I want to go on the road and then you are driving down by a bus.
[02:29] That is very, very unlucky.
[02:33] Yeah, you should not go there without light.
[02:35] You should have been walking more.
[02:37] In the side, you should not walk here.
[02:41] Yes.
[02:44] I think that it's not only about luck, you are lucky.
[02:49] You know how it is this, this is a big risk.
[02:53] But you don't hear.
[02:55] I am hearing you.
[02:59] Continuing living this life is also a big risk.
[03:12] You think there is another way.
[03:16] I have been having my own company invested in entrepreneur all my life.
[03:23] That's the way I earn my money with a big risk every time.
[03:29] Buying components from Spain, welding, big, big steel components, racing concrete in the ground, racing, and going to a buying install all.
[03:43] A big, big risk.
[03:46] Well, I did money.
[03:50] It's not the same as going to job 7 to 14 a day.
[03:56] It's not the same.
[04:13] We were very, very, very, very, very unlucky yesterday, the colonial.
[04:21] It was not fair, but we can't, we can talk about that from now on to ever.
[04:27] It's not going to change anything.
[04:35] So now,
[04:42] going to marry thousands of children,
[05:06] and I was talking to farmers....
[05:12] life. That just means that I have to do more hard than all other people because my luck.
[05:31] And so it is.
[06:02] I feel that you don't. We are not.
[06:11] You think that I don't know what you think. You think there is a man, your other possibilities and blah blah blah.
[06:26] We talk many times about all this, Claudia.
[06:40] I mean, it's only because I am positive and not only spout.
[06:48] Not only spout and not all.
[06:55] But I lived this life with reality in many years. You didn't.
[07:00] I have a... Yeah, but not here. Not in my situation, not in my country. Not with the chances.
[07:09] It's not because I don't want to run my company, Claudia. I would like.
[07:20] But I tried with so much marketing, work, blah blah blah. Many years finally.
[07:37] I just lost my life, my opportunities and my money. That's not a life.
[07:50] We need to do a plan.
[07:54] Actually, Claudia, you are not involved in this. You didn't lost one penny.
[08:01] No, because I don't know about this and I don't know.
[08:06] But I have... This is not the way that I choose.
[08:11] Someone has to do something here.
[08:14] Because I need to support you and the children. You can support yourself.
[08:21] But we know this and...
[08:24] Yeah, so you feel that it's not my fault now.
[08:29] I don't say that. I just say that we have to do something, Claudia.
[08:37] Yeah?
[08:40] I would like to say you something, but I need to translate.
[09:08] I need you to understand how I feel.
[09:14] I don't have the money to take care of all the things that I would like to do.
[09:29] I don't have to, Claudia. I was really things I would like to have.
[09:35] And the little money that I received from my kids' fathers is just enough to some basic needs.
[09:46] And just two days ago, when we was talking how you were winning, I decided to make two demo purchase.
[10:00] Because the children's need to close, winter clothes.
[10:05] And I did two purchase. One to about 700 Corona's.
[10:13] And the other around 800 Corona's. Because they needed winter clothes.
[10:19] You know how they have.
[10:23] And I am trying to cover in some things from the money that I received.
[10:33] For example, that toothpaste, shampoo, toilet paper.
[10:41] And when they want to drink some soda or some things.
[10:48] Because I am not claiming nothing honey.
[10:54] Because I want, it's my, the form that I want to help.
[10:59] And when I sometimes use things like how much toilet paper does family use.
[11:11] It really makes me feel sad because I don't want that you feel that you are the only person who supports this family.
[11:30] I am not spending anything extra.
[11:35] I am trying only to just try to cover what's necessary with the very little I have.
[11:45] So I also want to know that when your financial loss don't only affect you.
[11:56] They affect me too. And I am not blaming you. Nothing.
[12:01] But I need you to see that I have no resources left in these situations.
[12:10] Makes me feel sad.
[12:18] You don't think I know what you say.
[12:24] I know.
[12:25] And I want to translate this because sometimes I haven't done it.
[12:30] I know all this cloud.
[12:32] Why are you telling me that? I know it already.
[12:38] Because you want me to change, because you want...
[12:42] No. Because I am telling this because the next days when I went to...
[12:50] And I can show you, for example, I was looking at my economy because this day when I was talking to you,
[12:57] when you asked me for paid some things in the house.
[13:03] And I was looking at how I was spending all in this month in October.
[13:11] And I spent more than $400.
[13:16] Buying things for me is a lot because I haven't...
[13:24] I am not working.
[13:28] But it's important that we talk about this because I want to know how is my economy actually.
[13:39] And I can show you all with a credit all that is spending that I was doing because I don't want that you feel,
[13:49] that you are the ones that is supporting this family.
[13:53] And I would like to work for her.
[13:58] This is my wish because I am not a lazy person.
[14:02] I didn't say that.
[14:04] Yeah, I know that I want that you know that when you are worried, I am worried too.
[14:13] Because I am in this situation because I can't do nothing.
[14:19] Actually.
[14:23] And it makes me feel very sad because I see you that you have that responsibility with us,
[14:33] with the children having a night, doing nothing, and I am spending maybe one day that I have it.
[14:43] But I am also spending one day that I don't have.
[14:47] Yes.
[14:50] And when you use the little money that you have in this, how do you think that I feel?
[15:06] Because I know.
[15:08] I have the same feelings, cleverly, I am not stupid.
[15:11] Nothing we are talking like a couple.
[15:16] You don't have to explain me that you feel bad, I feel bad too.
[15:21] But that will not help, but that we sit here crying and say, I feel bad.
[15:25] It's not a solution.
[15:27] Okay.
[15:30] So for me and for us, I think that the way that I can help is trying to study by myself for don't spend time
[15:43] when I get the permission.
[15:50] I would like to find a virtual job.
[15:54] I know that I can't work in this country yet because it's a requirement.
[16:02] It's a rule.
[16:04] I need to respect.
[16:11] Then you have to work black or something.
[16:20] But we don't agree about this training.
[16:26] You don't believe in it.
[16:29] I believe in you.
[16:30] Yes, you believe in me.
[16:33] But you don't believe in the training.
[16:42] And I am trying to be very calm.
[16:44] I am trying to be rational.
[16:46] I am trying to think.
[16:49] I put it on the weight.
[16:52] Doing my company, doing my work, doing the training.
[16:56] It's a big risk, yes.
[17:00] But if this was not happening yesterday, if I had caught the money away, we was happy now.
[17:09] We were smiling because we win a lot of money.
[17:13] We have opportunity like an airplane.
[17:16] We were going like this, Claudia.
[17:21] You saw the numbers.
[17:24] You saw that I was more in control than ever.
[17:42] Is it a big risk to continue with your company, put more money and blah, blah, blah?
[17:47] It's a big risk.
[17:50] Now I get a little job here maybe.
[17:53] And I don't know if it's a money, but it will only cover a few things.
[17:58] He's calling me.
[18:00] I need to call him, please.
[18:02] Excuse me.
[18:23] Excuse me.
