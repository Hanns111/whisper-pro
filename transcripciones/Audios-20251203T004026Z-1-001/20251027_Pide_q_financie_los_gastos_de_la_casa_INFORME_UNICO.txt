B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] That's true about Linux.
[00:18] I called my revision company.
[00:41] I go to them to a meeting today.
[00:45] That's number one thing.
[00:53] You want to try to see to help me.
[00:57] Maybe I pay a little too much tax money in.
[01:01] We can stop to pay more tax for this year or get something back.
[01:06] We have to look on that.
[01:07] I get a little salary from my own company to my private account every month.
[01:18] But the company do not earn money.
[01:26] I can't keep on doing that.
[01:28] I have to put the money back into the account.
[01:35] I just pay more tax.
[01:41] We go to have a meeting with this.
[01:43] We try to make the best solution with that.
[01:46] That's number one info.
[01:48] Number two info.
[01:50] I called my bank.
[01:54] I didn't tell them everything.
[01:56] I just told him that in December my mother gave us, you can see, she did the last two years.
[02:04] We will have again.
[02:06] It's the same bank.
[02:08] I ask him what can we talk about.
[02:12] He can give me an extra bucket of 50,000 Danish kronor.
[02:30] 25 on my private account and 25 on my company account.
[02:42] So with the 50,000,
[02:47] I can have them in 45 days.
[02:52] And then I will get hopefully my mother's money.
[03:00] Let's say I didn't pay 10,000 for bills.
[03:04] We have 40 left.
[03:06] I am going to put those money into the investments.
[03:20] If I calculate 40,000 with the investments like it,
[03:28] no, that was too quickly for me.
[03:34] Sorry.
[03:42] I have one to wash my hands.
[03:59] If I am going to invest 40,000,
[04:22] I only use 25% of the 40,000 to actually trade with.
[04:34] That is 10,000.
[04:37] Those 10,000 giving a profit for one week of 140%.
[04:45] You can see the calculation here.
[04:48] And after one week,
[04:54] the total will be 24,000.
[05:01] And this is in the best scenery.
[05:21] This is the scenery we had this week.
[05:23] And this week was not especially good.
[05:26] Yeah?
[05:27] Okay.
[05:29] And what happened if you lost it?
[05:33] It's only a question.
[05:40] But you know, because I don't know about this.
[05:46] So if you consider that this is the way,
[05:49] but the banks accept finally.
[05:54] They don't know I do this here.
[05:56] I don't know.
[05:57] But they accept to give me more credit.
[06:04] In 45 days.
[06:08] I have to credit in 45 days.
[06:10] And then my mother's money arrives.
[06:12] Yeah.
[06:14] Okay.
[06:26] I want to take something here.
[06:32] This year, the state of T-touching holder offered a profit for one or a third percent.
[06:40] But my extra paying higher so all over the T-touching.
[06:56] I don't know.
[07:18] It's not true.
[07:19] I'll tell you, I will say, we still have T-touching holder.
[07:24] But I don't profit for one or a third percent.
[07:30] But my higher so change.
[08:24] Yeah.
[08:50] of doing this investment with 10,000 homeless is 14,000 homeless.
[09:11] If we have this salary, Claudia,
[09:17] we don't go this way.
[09:21] We will go this way.
[09:35] I'm not what I told you.
[09:39] Do you understand clearly?
[09:45] Yeah.
[09:47] Completely?
[09:49] Yeah, your idea.
[09:51] Also, the numbers.
[09:54] How you explain?
[10:09] Can you see this?
[10:16] I know what you think.
[10:19] There's two ways to earn money in this life.
[10:23] Work yourself.
[10:26] Work, work, work, work.
[10:29] Do you think I will be able to get this money?
[10:34] Do you think I will be able to get this kind of income for work one week?
[10:46] It will be impossible, Claudia.
[10:53] I understand how you say.
[10:59] You have the knowledge I don't know about this, but you explain me.
[11:06] If you consider all the risks and you have the control,
[11:12] I don't know about this, but you explain me.
[11:20] If you consider all the risks and you have the control,
[11:35] and you are ability for involved financially in this,
[11:46] I only can give you all the time my emotional support
[11:52] because I want the best for you, for us, always.
[12:00] And I don't want to see you sad.
[12:02] I don't want to see you nervous.
[12:06] But if I don't do anything now,
[12:12] I don't know what will happen with me.
[12:17] I...
[12:20] When I look all around me,
[12:28] and think in reality,
[12:39] there is no better solution than this.
[12:44] That is very, very clear.
[12:51] The only thing is that I need to do this training.
[12:58] I need to sit here, those hours,
[13:03] from early to late when they start,
[13:08] and be very, very specific and follow this here.
[13:14] And don't over-invest, don't take big risks,
[13:19] don't do anything mistakes.
[13:24] Now you can laugh at me, but...
[13:33] If I can sit here and be focused and have my time,
[13:39] I'm sure this here will be happening.
[13:43] And then, if you look on this number and say,
[13:50] this is the most important.
[13:56] This is your work.
[14:00] Because if I say, oh no, I have to go out to repair
[14:06] a little thing and earn 100 kong.
[14:10] Then I lost the possibility of earning 2000.
[14:16] Do you understand?
[14:21] And I understand your feelings.
[14:26] So I need my time, I need my space to say,
[14:30] now it's 3 o'clock, I have to stay here.
[14:35] I don't want you to look at me and say that you don't do anything here.
[14:44] You need to cook, you need to do this because...
[14:52] And I don't want to fight about this here.
[14:56] Lars.
[14:58] And I don't want to...
[15:03] I want you to understand Claudia.
[15:07] I understand you.
[15:10] Let's take an example.
[15:12] One day I sit here,
[15:16] push the buttons,
[15:21] two trains,
[15:26] we make money, of course we do.
[15:36] If I go out to do a little service,
[15:41] I earn only a little.
[15:44] If I'm focused here...
[15:50] Do you understand?
[15:52] Yes, and I have a question.
[15:54] What do you expect about me?
[15:57] That I respect your times?
[16:00] And I can do that because I always respect your time.
[16:04] And if you need an extra help,
[16:07] I can do, I only...
[16:09] I wish that you be calm.
[16:13] The thing is that I don't...
[16:16] I want to take as much control
[16:20] and risk control as ever possible.
[16:25] So that requires that when they give me the system,
[16:28] now it's time, I'm going to go sit here.
[16:32] Look, follow.
[16:34] Is it going correctly?
[16:38] And if I see something go wrong,
[16:41] I can stop it because I am focused here.
[16:44] I'm not standing out there drinking coffee or,
[16:48] you know, away because the market you see,
[16:53] it goes, okay?
[16:57] And I can't do two hours of cooking
[17:03] when I don't know what's happening here with my money,
[17:06] I invest with my risk.
[17:11] Do you think we can agree about this without looking
[17:17] with bad eyes?
[17:21] Of course.
[17:23] And you know that I am doing my best.
[17:26] I am happy because I am...
[17:28] I don't say I am just trying
[17:33] to be very honest,
[17:36] that for me it's also about what I feel.
[17:40] Because let's say another thing out here,
[17:44] if you was not here and I knew I have to do this,
[17:48] then I will just take a little breath
[17:52] and put something on place here and drink my coffee and eat.
[17:56] I don't care because this is my work,
[18:01] this is my money, this is no.
[18:04] I have the opportunities.
[18:07] If I don't push the button,
[18:11] the right time,
[18:17] it's like going to work without an early and anacelary.
[18:23] And the situation
[18:27] with our economy is going like this now.
[18:32] And this is the surface.
[18:35] We need to change this idea.
[18:39] Really.
[18:43] But I don't want.
[18:45] I want that you know what's going on.
[18:48] I want to know that we can make this agreement.
[18:52] That's how it is.
[19:05] I understand.
[19:08] Of course, if there is calling me,
[19:11] can you go to do a little job for me here?
[19:14] And I can do that before three o'clock.
[19:17] I will do that of course and take those money too.
[19:23] But I will not because this here I earn ten times more
[19:29] with my time investment.
[19:34] I understand you.
[19:38] I am doing my things.
[19:40] I am trying to do my own things.
[19:44] That's good too, Claudia.
[19:47] Because you need your time.
[19:49] I need my time.
[19:51] But that's not means that we can't share time together
[19:54] when you come and when I come.
[19:57] But right now we have an economy-can situation.
[20:00] We have to take very seriously close.
[20:03] And then this is priority number one.
[20:09] When I say share, I don't say spend money.
[20:13] I say share maybe.
[20:15] But I respect.
[20:17] I am totally ready with you.
[20:19] I have many things to do here.
[20:21] For example, I go with a computer to the second floor
[20:25] because I want to study.
[20:29] I want to do a speak.
[20:32] I can sit in the table and when I go through.
[20:37] And I can study quite and come.
[20:42] I don't need to stay in front of you when you are doing this.
[20:45] Because maybe you disturb me and I disturb you.
[20:49] No, but in the start when I did this here,
[20:53] there was an obligation on me that I should buy the food.
[20:58] I should do all the food.
[21:00] I have to do the trading.
[21:02] And it was impossible for me to know that.
[21:04] I am now not necessary because now I can cook.
[21:11] So I am happy because each day I am given a little step more.
[21:22] I do it for my own, for my own dessert.
[21:29] I cook and I can continue doing that.
[21:33] Because today this was a goal for me.
[21:38] Because now I can learn.
[21:42] Of course you can cook.
[21:44] Yes, of course.
[21:46] And I am doing.
[21:47] Because you have two hands.
[21:49] Yes.
[21:50] You have eyes, you have ears.
[21:52] So of course you can.
[21:54] People who say they can't cook, I say holy Christ.
[21:58] Yes, but I am doing.
[22:01] Yes.
[22:02] I am happy because I am doing.
[22:06] The problem is that the time when the sickness is coming is around.
[22:13] You know how it is three o'clock and maybe two or eleven.
[22:18] And that's how it is.
[22:24] But I prefer to do this because I know there is money in this.
[22:30] And there is a lot of money.
[22:32] I can't work the same money out in the reality.
[22:39] It's impossible.
[22:42] And I will not, if I work with my back, 80 hours, you saw me working.
[22:48] Taking templates every day.
[22:50] It's not, I like my work.
[22:54] But this, this here.
[22:57] And I have been looking on this here, Claudia.
[23:02] Thank you for sharing your feelings.
[23:05] Thank you for sharing what are you thinking?
[23:09] And thank you for sharing what is your plan?
[23:13] Because I understand it.
[23:16] And we have now an agreement.
[23:20] About this, I am going to respect your time.
[23:24] I have to do two things here.
[23:29] And this is my 50% in this house.
[23:35] Maybe it's 80% now.
[23:37] In a time, Claudia.
[23:39] I can't do it.
[23:42] For example, I have...
[23:44] First of all, we have to agree that this here is the most highest priority
[23:48] because without this...
[23:51] And when do you think that you can be able to do that?
[23:56] From... hopefully tomorrow.
[24:03] But tomorrow I have to go to a election meeting.
[24:09] I only have a question because now you say that you are very busy.
[24:15] So that means that the appointment that I have is possible that I go along.
[24:22] I can't remember what time it was.
[24:25] Three o'clock, thirty October.
[24:32] But maybe I will have my phone woke.
[24:35] We can do like that.
[24:38] Or maybe if you have to do this three o'clock,
[24:45] maybe only you can leave me there and I can come back on the bus.
[24:51] Because I was looking at the bus.
[24:55] I can just stay.
[24:57] I just need...
[24:59] I can do it from my phone too.
[25:04] If I have to, but normally I would like to sit here with the control, the electricity.
[25:13] So nothing is going wrong.
[25:15] I sit here quiet.
[25:17] Or is organized.
[25:19] I look...
[25:20] For that reason, I pretend...
[25:21] Instead of sitting in a room with a stress and what's going on and what will happen if I lose the power from the telephone.
[25:30] For that reason, I would like that we have an agreement about this day.
[25:36] Because you are not going to be focused with your mobile.
[25:41] So maybe the best solution, because I want to be considering.
[25:51] That maybe...
[25:56] I have to wait for Juan Diego.
[26:00] Because he arrived to...
[26:04] 10th o'clock the bus.
[26:08] I can wait for him.
[26:10] He entered.
[26:11] I prepared all for his class.
[26:14] Maybe you can leave me before 3.
[26:17] I can wait.
[26:19] But you can come back at home before 3 o'clock.
[26:24] And I can wait there.
[26:26] And I can go by myself to the bus and come back in the bus.
[26:31] Maybe I can back around 5 o'clock because the last bus I was looking.
[26:37] It's also possible that I can drive for you, Claudia.
[26:40] Don't worry for me.
[26:42] If you want to help me to be more independent, let me do that.
[26:49] We can talk about that when we are in the situation.
[26:54] Because it's not because everything is impossible.
[26:57] You just have to understand that.
[27:04] If I am not focused, if I am not doing this, we don't earn the money.
[27:10] If you look at this here as the most important thing as a work,
[27:20] you have to invest your time and your eyes.
[27:25] And then you can...
[27:30] This is the reality, Claudia.
[27:36] I have a question.
[27:38] If I decide to go, for example, because we will happen.
[27:44] It's a possibility that you receive the signal early.
[27:49] And we never know.
[27:50] Exactly.
[27:51] If I go with my bicycle, I think that I should be driving around 30 minutes.
[28:01] If I want to come back, I can enter to the bus with my bicycle.
[28:08] It's possible that.
[28:18] I'm going to investigate in work.
[28:20] I'm not sure.
[28:22] I think, but I'm not sure.
[28:30] But always we can find solutions.
[28:38] That's easy to say, Claudia.
[28:40] It's the same as maybe there will be 25 degrees in January.
[28:45] No, it will not Claudia.
[28:51] I understand.
[28:53] I understand perfectly.
[28:56] I can give you my opinion about...
[28:59] Of course we can always give opinion.
[29:02] No, I mean that I can be involved in trading things because it's not my knowledge.
[29:11] So I can't give my opinion about if this is...
[29:16] Because I don't know.
[29:18] But if I understand what I'm just blaming, I'm going to give you my support
[29:28] with the things in the house if it's necessary 60, 70, 80%.
[29:35] In the time.
[29:37] In the time of course.
[29:42] And do you have a little budget the next one, two weeks to help with the food?
[29:58] Or is it impossible?
[30:04] I am using my credit card.
[30:09] And that means what?
[30:18] That I...
[30:21] I'm going to do my numbers too because I'm paying the English teacher.
[30:31] I bought the shoes and the jacket, the boys.
[30:39] With the credit card, I am paying that.
[30:43] And I think that I can use my credit card in the next week too.
[30:56] As always.
[31:00] No, I ask you specific what is possible and what is not possible.
[31:07] Because we...
[31:09] I don't want we go into next week or Friday and then we have cars about this too.
[31:14] We have to make a control about a plan.
[31:18] About all.
[31:20] Yeah, but take a call with the car.
[31:24] I can drive.
[31:27] I talk about the economy.
[31:36] How much is that?
[31:40] I don't know.
[31:42] You know when you buy the food last time, you know how much it was.
[31:50] But we have rises low price and we have potatoes.
[31:55] We have meat in the fridge.
[31:58] Of course we need to buy a little other things.
[32:01] Yeah, I can do a low budget.
[32:07] Okay, for the next two weeks.
[32:12] I think something like that.
[32:15] Because if I need to take out more money from the investments,
[32:24] I will not win as much money.
[32:33] Do you understand?
[32:35] Yes.
[32:37] If I only invest 1000 homeless instead of 10,000 homeless,
[32:44] there is a big difference in the winning.
[32:48] You understand?
[32:50] Yeah.
[33:07] Are you able to do this a little moment, Claudia?
[33:11] Or is it totally impossible?
[33:14] No.
[33:16] Because I am doing a risky tool, Claudia.
[33:24] Do you mean yes or do you say yes or mean no?
[33:28] No, I say that I can't in the next two weeks.
[33:32] Because if I use the money in the next two weeks,
[33:38] I am not a debit card.
[33:42] It is a credit card.
[33:44] So you don't have the money?
[33:46] No.
[33:47] I don't know what means a debit and credit.
[33:49] Do you have money or not have money?
[33:51] No, I haven't.
[33:53] You haven't money.
[33:55] Zero.
[33:56] I am using the money that I receive from the rent.
[34:03] And you know that I have to pay.
[34:06] And little and the money that hangs sent for the children.
[34:11] So this money I can use.
[34:14] So you have a...
[34:19] You have a...
[34:22] On your account or minus?
[34:29] I don't understand.
[34:31] Do you have plus on your account or minus?
[34:34] No, I am a half-dum-one that hangs sent me.
[34:39] I know.
[34:40] Yes.
[34:41] And I can pay with this using my credit card.
[34:45] Because I use the credit card and when she...
[34:48] The question is, do you have money or don't you have money?
[34:53] No, I have the money that I receive for the rent.
[34:57] Yeah, but I also have the money I received from my rent, from my second house.
[35:02] So the question is still the same.
[35:05] Do you have money?
[35:07] No matter where they are from.
[35:09] Yes or no?
[35:12] Yes, I have this money.
[35:15] But I need to use the money for pay.
[35:19] And I have a small...
[35:22] Yes, for pay.
[35:23] How much do you have left over when you paid to the bank?
[35:32] Exactly.
[35:36] I mean that I have an accident around...
[35:43] In...
[35:46] The change of who hangs sent me is around...
[35:54] An accident about...
[35:59] About $500.
[36:01] And with this I can pay.
[36:04] Okay.
[36:07] That's okay Claudia.
[36:09] Okay.
[36:12] Then I think we have a plan.
[36:20] Because we was on this way.
[36:23] Now I think we have a plan Claudia.
[36:26] But we have to help each other to do this in this way.
[36:33] I will feel much more comfortable when I have the money in my account.
[36:46] I can put me into the training because then I can see that this is moving.
[36:52] And I will feel much more comfortable.
[37:11] I wish the best for you, for us.
[37:16] I wish I could be able to work.
[37:23] Because when you...
[37:26] The reality is not that you are not going to work soon.
[37:29] You know that too.
[37:32] The reality is that we have to try to find a economy now.
[37:38] But I am going to work.
[37:41] Yes, but that will not be soon Claudia.
[37:44] That too.
[37:47] Do you think that it is not possible?
[37:51] When you say so, I don't believe it Claudia.
[37:58] With the CPR, if I go to the job center...
[38:07] There will maybe be some possibilities for work Claudia.
[38:12] The next question is, do you want to have this work?
[38:16] What time do you have?
[38:18] You have a boy with disabilities.
[38:24] Maybe he can apply for some health.
[38:28] And this is going to help the economy.
[38:34] I don't know all the rules about this Claudia.
[38:37] I just know that I don't.
[38:40] You don't...
[38:44] You only have the time you have Claudia.
[38:47] You only also have the capacity you have.
[38:51] Mentally.
[38:54] We all only have 100% capacity.
[39:01] Mentally, energy, time.
[39:05] So dreaming about that I want to go to Hawaii today, be tomorrow.
[39:10] At work and the next day I want to fly to Miami.
[39:14] It's not possible.
[39:17] You will be very stressed if you have to go every morning with the childrens and work and buy food and take care and many things Claudia.
[39:47] Have you been thinking about this?
[39:50] Yes, but...
[39:53] Have you been thinking about that Claudia?
[39:57] Yes.
[40:00] Of course, yes.
[40:10] Are you an strong person?
[40:13] Yes, I know that Claudia.
[40:16] But now.
[40:18] Or see when people die.
[40:20] But now we need to be out of the battery.
[40:24] But now?
[40:26] Don't you know what I mean?
[40:28] Yes.
[40:29] But now we need to be focused in this.
[40:32] Okay?
[40:33] So that's it for me.
[40:36] I'm not worried.
[40:38] I only want to be quite calm with our stressful training to be okay on the way.
[40:54] Stayed by a step.
[40:56] But this world is not easy.
[40:59] Yes.
[41:01] Now.
[41:10] I don't know me and you are not.
[41:12] We talk many times about that we are very, very unlucky.
[41:17] Do you know the word, what unlucky is?
[41:21] You can be lucky.
[41:24] You know what lucky is.
[41:26] You can also be the opposite.
[41:31] And actually me and you are not we talk sometimes.
[41:34] We are afraid to wake up in the morning because what is going to happen now?
[41:48] That's why it's very important that we have to do a change right now because we don't know what is coming.
[41:59] Okay, I understand you.
[42:06] Hmm?
[42:09] The good news is that we have things here for cook in the next days.
[42:17] That's only short time.
[42:19] I want to think long distance.
[42:23] Long time, Claudia.
[42:25] I look the long way.
[42:28] What is the solution?
[42:31] The solution is not continuing like we have to do.
[42:42] Okay.
[42:49] That was my words.
[42:54] And I have to realize I am living in another reality now.
[43:00] I have to find the budgets for my kids.
[43:04] I have to pay for them every month.
[43:08] And that is a big, big, expensive cost that I didn't have before.
[43:24] But with this idea, giving me the space, the feeling that is okay, I am sitting here because it's a part of the life.
[43:46] I will be more calm to say, okay, you accept?
[43:51] Because continuing in a situation with out of control and stress about what I do, that's not a life for me, Claudia.
[44:09] Then I will run away.
[44:12] One day I will take my auto cab and drive to, I don't know where, I am running away.
[44:19] And I can put a fire for this plate and I am away.
[44:23] I don't want to live that life.
[44:27] I am going to continue with my things.
[44:31] We can talk later about, if you want to talk, but now be quiet.
[44:40] Don't speak more about financial things.
[44:46] We can continue talking later.
[44:50] But we have an agreement now and you understand.
[44:54] I understand.
[45:02] I need to continue.
[45:10] Tomorrow you are going to do this.
[45:16] No?
[45:19] There is an election meeting tomorrow.
[45:27] I have to do a plan with that too to see.
[45:32] I can cook today.
[45:35] The only thing that I would like is how did you cook the murmur plate?
[45:41] That's the only thing that I want to learn.
[45:44] I can do that in 10 minutes. It's not a problem.
[45:47] Okay.
[45:49] I can cook in 15 minutes maybe for, I finished to do my things in the second floor and I can't help you cook the strawberries.

      Long time, Claudia.

    [43:51 - 44:09] Severidad: BAJA
