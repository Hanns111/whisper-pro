[03:22] Mom, what's your name?
[03:24] I'm Jose Felipe.
[03:26] I'm from the other side.
[03:28] You know what I mean.
[03:30] Yeah, but...
[03:31] I've made a mess.
[03:33] And you've been born.
[03:35] You've never been born.

[03:47] Jandiego.
[03:48] What's your name?
[03:49] I don't know.
[03:50] I'm from the Gulf.
[03:51] And that's not true.
[03:52] But, Mom, don't worry.
[03:54] I know, honey.
[03:56] Where is it?
[03:58] It's here.
[04:00] No, no.
[04:01] Hey, it's here.
[04:02] Yeah.
[04:03] Lars.
[04:04] Jandiego is here.
[04:06] And I believe in him.
[04:09] Because he don't like.
[04:12] Okay?
[04:13] And Jose Carlos is here.
[04:15] And he's in his bedroom.
[04:17] And he says that he didn't do.
[04:19] Okay?
[04:20] Jandiego, say he didn't do that.
[04:23] Did you did it?
[04:25] I don't do it.
[04:27] Mm-hmm.
[04:29] Mm-hmm.
[04:31] And I believe in his world.
[04:34] Because he never lied.
[04:37] In his condition,
[04:39] he...
[04:40] Jose Carlos...
[04:42] Well, he was here to see...
[04:45] Jose Carlos...
[04:48] Jose Carlos...
[04:50] Jose Carlos...
[04:52] Jose Carlos...
[04:54] Jose Carlos...
[04:56] Jose Carlos...
[04:58] Jose Carlos...
[05:00] Jose Carlos...
[05:03] We don't want problems, but we do.
[05:06] Mm-hmm.
[05:10] And it makes me feel...
[05:15] anxious and nervous because they didn't, and we didn't.
[05:25] Okay?
[05:26] So it's not impossible a ghost.
[05:30] Okay?
[05:34] Jandiego never, never lied.
[05:39] Because in his condition, in his situation,
[05:43] they always want to...
[05:47] to be...
[05:49] feel the same way that Jose always, for his condition,
[05:52] he's afraid of lying.
[05:54] Tell him that.
[05:56] For his condition, Jandiego has...
[05:59] fear to lie.
[06:01] You can't lie.
[06:03] So, I am not lying.
[06:07] I am not lying.
[06:09] And this is the third time that you are trying to think,
[06:13] tell you that he and I, and he's not sure.
[06:17] Okay?
[06:20] Before you arrived to this house,
[06:24] this wall was complete.
[06:27] Now we see, not only one time,
[06:30] not only two times.
[06:33] Now three times,
[06:37] with evidence.
[06:40] When I went to the bathroom, I checked the wall.
[06:44] It was normal, and I was one of less.
[06:47] And now it's broken somehow.
[06:50] I don't know how.
[06:52] When we arrived from the trip to there, he was in the toilet.
[06:55] So...
[06:56] No?
[06:57] No?
[06:58] Yes.
[06:59] No?
[07:00] No, he was.
[07:01] But after the last.
[07:02] But he didn't, because I was there, and it didn't.
[07:07] And I make sure it was normal.
[07:09] And now it's broken.
[07:11] Yes.
[07:13] So, who do you think it is?
[07:16] Not me.
[07:17] Not me, Jandiego.
[07:18] And not you.
[07:19] No, we didn't.
[07:21] Do you think I do it?
[07:23] I'm not saying that guy.
[07:24] Do you think I destroyed my own house?
[07:27] I'm saying we did it.
[07:30] We didn't.
[07:31] Who has been in this house?
[07:34] We don't know.
[07:36] And you...
[07:38] You make me...
[07:40] Like a fool.
[07:42] What's happening in fool?
[07:45] Fool.
[07:46] Don't talk.
[07:49] No, anybody say that.
[07:51] And what do we do then?
[07:53] And we finish this because we didn't.
[07:55] And we did that.
[07:57] So, next time it's happening, when all the wall is taken down, who did it?
[08:03] I'm going to take a video about this.
[08:06] Because I am very anxious waiting here, but you are accusing me.
[08:11] He is having a...
[08:14] You are accusing me here.
[08:16] And you...
[08:17] Can I destroy something of your thinks?
[08:23] I don't understand.
[08:25] No.
[08:26] No.
[08:27] Because you are saying that he is...
[08:31] He has a disability.
[08:33] He is not about disability.
[08:35] No, but this is about what is removing from the wall.
[08:38] Yeah, but he didn't.
[08:39] He is saying that he didn't.
[08:41] Okay.
[08:42] And now...
[08:43] Maybe you are doing this because you want to accuse us to leave the house.
[08:48] Yeah, but...
[08:50] No.
[08:51] I think...
[08:53] I am thinking.
[08:55] Yeah, you think a lot of things.
[08:56] Come on, little guys.
[08:57] That is not true.
[08:59] You don't know how I did it.
[09:01] You know that.
[09:02] I don't know now.
[09:04] Exactly.
[09:05] Come on.
[09:07] What happened to my channel?
[09:09] Nothing.
[09:10] You are taking it.
[09:11] You are not doing it.
[09:12] I don't know.
[09:15] I don't know.
[09:16] I just saw it.
[09:17] I just saw it.
