 You are an airy spare, an airy spare for people. But if you think that is not possible to share together, I am agree that you can go and we can stay here. You can spend your time with your friends and we can stay here at home. And I am okay with that decision. I am still not believe, you don't know who did it. I believe in you. You don't believe, you don't know who did it. I believe in you. You believe in me. And when I say it's him, you say no, it's not. I only say you that I ask him, and he say no. And that is the reality, what he say. Because he is airy normal. When you say that he is very normal, you are saying that with another world. Because you know that he is in a spectrum of this. You don't have to explain me things, I already know one million times, Claudia. I get question in my head. Sometimes your worlds are idonic. Yes, they are because this is question. This was not here before, we are four people. And you think I am a complete idiot. And there is no other people visiting us. So it's very simple. You have a son who lives for you now. But you don't accept that. Because if you are little boy, he can do whatever he wants. If he wants to piss in the corner, he can do it. I am accepting your words. You are protecting him, no matter what he does. I am accepting your words. I don't want problems, please. No. I am accepting your words. It's because you don't see this here as a problem. What do you think if he was... Let's take another situation. Let's say we go to some of my friends and he did the same in their houses. What do you think will happen then? Do you have an insurance to pay for that? Do you think the family will visit they accept that? So who has a problem? You have a problem. You are all a protected feminist situation, which your children is destroying them. But you don't recognize. And now you believe in him. What do you... I want you to see the reality, but it's not going to happen. What do you expect about me? What do you want that I do? Tell me, please, because I want to give a solution now. I don't think there is no solution because you are mentally developed in many, many years. It's a kind of... That will not change because I say a few words. You are your own person, you do whatever you want. You are the big lawyer from Peru. You can do whatever you want. We are here, we are in them. I am doing my best. You also told me those words. So I know where they come from. They come deep in straight from your herd. My actions. You know what I am doing at home. I am trying to do the best for us. I am cooking all day. But you also have two children. It's not my children. But we are a family. You don't need to do anything for me. Zero. I can do my own little bread for me. It takes me very few minutes before you arrived. My life was very, very uncomplicated. Very quiet. Without any problem. Nothing. Yes. I want to, I love you. We have a project of life. Yeah, who will never be finished because this is will never going to change. They are going to do their own life. No. Yes, because they are growing and there are many places where they can go and they do their own life. I know you Claudia. That is not going to be reality. Yes. Because I love, I want a life with you. This is not a life for me Claudia. I am so stressed. Yes. I am so stressed. Yes. I am so stressed. Yes. I am so stressed. Yes. And I think every day I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to live anymore. Please, take it. Two worlds make me feel very sad. Yeah, me too. Because I always can fight and go over the surface. But no, I can't. I think every day I don't want more. There is no use for me. Okay. And I know that you are worried for the money because you want money for continuing investing in that crypto. I know that you lost the money there, but it is not our fault. I know that you don't have to explain me that. I am very responsible about also when I did something wrong. But those things make you feel sad. All. It's a combination. But when I see my property here, I have no money. I try to save. All the money I can. And I see a person destroying my house without accepting or he doesn't care. Simply don't care. Yes. It's fucking don't care. Okay. I promise you that it's not going to happen again. I promise you. This is it. There is more destroyed in this house. You know that too. It's not going to happen. I am going to do my business. Okay. Please. I don't want to fight too much. I want a quiet life with two of you. Yes. The living me. But who is going to pay? I'm going to pay. Who is going to pay for the telephone? Who is going to pay for the internet? We don't have the money, Claudia. Yeah. And you want to go to a party to 2000 homeless? I don't have that money. I don't want to go to any party. You told me yesterday. I asked you about that party from the last year. But I never said. You're not for free. Yeah, but I never said. Do you know how much I spent in you last time for this party? And how was your behavior? That even in two? Yes, please. We don't need to talk about the party because I don't want to go to any party. I am here to stay with you. And I want to do the scenes. So please, please, please, please, please, please.
