[02:02] Yes, and I ask you a question.
[02:04] You don't believe it's one of your boys?
[02:07] I believe that I talk with them.
[02:12] And they say no?
[02:14] Yes.
[02:15] Both?

[02:17] And you believe in that?
[02:19] Yes, why not?
[02:27] Now I have two pictures with evidence.
[02:31] And there's no other people here in this house.
[02:35] And you believe the boys?
[02:37] Yes, but you have two pictures of...
[02:42] Okay.
[02:43] But you have an opinion about them.
[02:49] So, I don't want to discuss with you.
[02:53] If you consider that was a day, I don't want to get a discussion.
[02:59] I know who it is and you know it too.
[03:01] No, I don't.
[03:03] So, you don't believe it's one of the boys?
[03:05] Yes, I don't want to get a discussion with you.
[03:08] I want to get a solution.
[03:11] If you feel that we were, please, we are ready to...
[03:18] Let me know how we have to pay for fix this part of the wall.
[03:24] I don't want to get a discussion.
[03:27] So, you don't?
[03:29] I don't want to get a discussion.
[03:31] I don't ask you...
[03:33] It is on the egg.
[03:34] And you know it.
[03:39] Lars, I want to tell you something.
[03:42] When I got never, never used to lie.
[03:48] When he used to do something, he said when he got a mistake.
[03:54] But you are a firm, something.
[03:58] Who has been in this house the last two days?
[04:03] All.
[04:04] Yes.
[04:05] Do you think I destroyed my own house?
[04:08] Lars, I am not saying nothing and I am not blaming you about...
[04:13] Blame me for...
[04:15] No, I am not saying that you have the fork in any moment.
[04:22] I say that.
[04:25] Okay, please.
[04:30] We are quite.
[04:31] I just finished the dinner, please.
[04:34] But please, we are in a situation now that no one did it.
[04:42] I am saying that I accept the work of the world.
[04:46] It's falling down off its own without anyone touching.
[04:49] I accept that of the possibility.
[04:54] But the problem we discussed at one time and the problem is continuing.
[05:01] And you still believe, don't believe.
[05:06] Lars, we had a big problem the last night.
[05:12] When you were talking about this, I was a problem.
[05:16] And I sure that any in the house wants to get a problem.
[05:22] No, but it continues.
[05:24] Yes, but...
[05:28] The same person did it again.
[05:42] I accept to pay for that.
[05:46] Okay?
[05:48] To fix this.
[05:54] That's all.
[05:58] That's all, since my...
[06:02] So you think it's okay that they continue?
[06:05] I don't want to have a fight.
[06:08] No, but I don't want this to continue happening.
[06:12] No, it's not going to continue.
[06:14] No, it's happening two times.
[06:16] Yes, but I don't know what is happening.
[06:18] You don't know what's happening.
[06:20] No, I don't know.
[06:22] You don't want that I accept something that I can't accept.
[06:27] Because I talk with my boss, boys, and they say that they didn't.
[06:33] I told you today, don't call him about this because I know it's not him.
[06:40] I talk with boss.
[06:42] Yes.
[06:45] I talk with boss.
[06:47] But you are not reasonable, Claudia.
[06:49] I am trying to be reasonable.
[06:52] But you are not?
[06:54] Lars, I am accepting that I'm going to pay.
[06:57] It's not about...
[07:00] It's not about that, Claudia.
[07:02] Yes, it's about that you...
[07:05] Okay, you are sure that you are saying with your finger that is on the end.
[07:12] It is?
[07:14] Okay, you say this.
[07:16] Yes.
[07:18] Okay.
[07:20] So you are saying that we are only four people in this house.
[07:25] Yes, but this is not an evidence.
[07:27] So who is it then?
[07:29] Lars, I don't want to fight.
[07:31] No, but I don't want to be in this nonsense.
[07:34] Lars, I don't want to fight.
[07:36] No, but I don't want my house more destroyed.
[07:39] But...
[07:40] But you don't care.
[07:41] No one cares.
[07:42] It's a poor care.
[07:43] And now you lie.
[07:44] They lie and you don't believe.
[07:47] She doesn't lie.
[07:49] He don't lie?
[07:50] No.
[07:51] So who did it?
[07:53] Lars.
[07:54] No, I want questions now.
[07:57] I don't know.
[07:58] Who did it?
[07:59] I don't know Lars.
[08:00] Okay.
[08:01] And you believe it's not him?
[08:03] Lars, okay.
[08:05] And...
[08:08] This is two questions, Claudia.
[08:11] Lars, please, what do you...
[08:17] Um...
[08:19] This is two questions, Claudia.
[08:25] I can't accept this here.
[08:27] I can accept too.
[08:29] Good.
[08:30] Then we stop.
[08:33] Yeah.
[08:34] You have to find another place to live, Claudia.
[08:37] What?
[08:38] You have to find another place to live.
[08:42] What do you see, Lars?
[08:45] You can't accept it.
[08:47] I can't accept it.
[08:48] Lars, please.
[08:52] I don't know what is happening.
[08:54] I know.
[08:56] What?
[08:58] You can't accept, I can't accept.
[09:01] No, Lars.
[09:02] This is not fair.
[09:04] You...
[09:05] Not fair.
[09:06] You say me that we have to try to find another place where to live.
[09:11] Are you listening?
[09:13] What are you saying?
[09:15] Are you listening?
[09:17] What you are telling me?
[09:19] I say that I accept that pay for this.
[09:23] It's not about paying, Claudia.
[09:25] Yeah.
[09:26] It's about admitting that someone is destroying this house.
[09:30] And they live on a lie and you believe them.
[09:33] No, Lars.
[09:34] You make me feel bad, Lars, because you know that...
[09:37] You make me feel bad.
[09:39] Lars, I haven't worked to live here.
[09:43] And you know what is my situation?
[09:47] Yeah, and my situation too.
[09:54] Claudia.
[09:58] I don't understand what is happening.
[10:01] No.
[10:04] But we talked about this before, Claudia.
[10:07] Lars.
[10:22] Okay.
[10:24] If I accept that he is...
[10:27] It's not about accepting that you don't understand.
[10:30] You don't want to...
[10:34] Now, Claudia, this is not a life for me.
[10:37] It is not...
[10:39] It is not a life for me, Claudia.
[10:48] What are you expecting about?
[10:50] I am trying to do all...
[10:52] Like your wife, I am doing all the things.
[10:56] I don't understand what is happening.
[10:58] It is not about doing things, Claudia.
[11:05] I am so stressed about this life.
[11:09] I am mentally...
[11:15] But you don't care.
[11:17] Nobody cares about me.
[11:19] Of course I am doing all the things here.
[11:22] I am cleaning and cooking my English in your clothes.
[11:25] I am doing all the things here.
[11:27] How many is in this family?
[11:30] Four.
[11:31] Yes. Who come with three?
[11:33] Lars, please.
[11:35] I don't want to buy.
[11:37] No.
[11:38] I say you as a beginning, please.
[11:40] I understand that you have problems with your economy now.
[11:44] And I accept when you say that I have to pay for the food.
[11:49] And I was...
[11:51] You say that I have to pay with my credit card.
[11:54] And I am doing...
[11:57] I am happy in the school.
[12:01] But we are running in...
[12:06] Claudia, we are not happy.
[12:09] We are running in chaos from the morning to the evening.
[12:14] If I don't...
[12:16] If I never do nothing...
[12:19] It's not about do, Claudia.
[12:22] They are in the school.
[12:24] They are not here.
[12:26] For example, you say now that you can't rest.
[12:31] But I was watching a movie with my boys in the Jose Carlos room.
[12:36] And anybody was doing anything noisy.
[12:41] We were sitting.
[12:46] You are not having the reality that I have Claudia.
[12:51] You are not feeling the reality that I feel.
[12:56] This is not a life for me, Claudia.
[13:00] And why you don't think about this when you know me.
[13:05] When you say that you was falling in love with me.
[13:09] Why you lied to me?
[13:11] Because I come here to this country because I am falling in love with you.
[13:17] Because I love you.
[13:19] And you speak me.
[13:22] If you don't care about my feelings.
[13:25] It's not about that, Claudia.
[13:28] Maybe you are talking with another person.
[13:31] Tell me the truth.
[13:34] Because I feel that you don't love me.
[13:38] I don't know because I do I use your behavior with me.
[13:42] What I live all, and I am here with my boys.
[13:47] They are having the school, they are having a life here.
[13:51] Not only about you, Claudia.
[13:54] It's not all about you.
[13:57] It's about you.
[14:00] It's a combination of all Claudia.
[14:06] I have never been so...
[14:11] Sometimes you say that you want to die.
[14:14] That you want to...
[14:17] That's why I have to do something, Claudia.
[14:20] But to make me feel what when you say this.
[14:25] I am nervous because I don't know if maybe I am doing something wrong.
[14:30] And I don't understand.
[14:33] No.
[14:35] We can't talk, we can't do, we can't act, we can't speak about who did what.
[14:41] No one wants to admit.
[14:43] We can't do nothing, we can't go a trip, we have no joy, we have no money, we have no possibilities.
[14:50] We cannot speak together, we are not the same.
[14:54] You come from a government work, I come from another world of freedom.
[14:59] And we are not...
[15:02] And you...
[15:05] You of course...
[15:08] Of course, you love your voice.
[15:11] Of course you do that.
[15:14] But when you say I can sleep in the coach and I can have my time,
[15:20] you don't hear the reality that I hear.
[15:24] Big noise and stress for me is like...
[15:31] Canvas.
[15:34] But you don't know how it is to be me.
[15:37] You don't hear the things, what's going on?
[15:40] I did not.
[15:47] There are also we are not animals, we are not objects.
[15:51] I don't say that, Claudia.
[15:54] But I didn't say that.
[15:59] I am not an object that you can say today.
[16:03] I want to, in the next day, I don't want you.
[16:07] You can't go out from here.
[16:09] It's not about one cloud, it's about that if we look on the reality's cloud, yeah.
[16:17] We are not animals.
[16:20] I didn't say that.
[16:22] But you will hear your words.
[16:25] You have to go to other place.
[16:28] What is your...
[16:32] One more.
[16:35] I can't say nothing.
[16:46] Why did you expect about me?
[16:48] I don't expect anything, Claudia.
[16:51] It's just been more than I can.
[16:58] I didn't know how this was, Claudia.
[17:14] What about us?
[17:18] I don't know, Claudia.
[17:24] I don't know, but I don't feel comfortable, Claudia.
[17:30] I'm not happy.
[17:34] I can't support this economy.
[17:40] I'm getting...
[17:43] I don't feel very Claudia.
[17:46] I don't feel well.
[17:50] I...
[17:57] And from the start, I had to explain.
[18:01] Explain.
[18:03] Explain. Explain.
[18:06] And we have a lot of chaos.
[18:09] What the fuck?
[18:12] We are wrong with you, Claudia.
[18:15] What do you say that Lars?
[18:19] Okay.
[18:22] We couldn't even go into the garden.
[18:26] We could do...
[18:28] And we still can't do nothing.
[18:31] Lars, this is not true.
