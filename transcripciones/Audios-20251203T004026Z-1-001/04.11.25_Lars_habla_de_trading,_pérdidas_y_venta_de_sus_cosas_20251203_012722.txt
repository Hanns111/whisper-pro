Lars ... ...dear it ... ...dear it ... 24 jaar, Some of your friends, we were at the party and you have to talk with Helma because he is also training. That does not mean that if other do that with two, I mean that with all the money that just are the loose, many people can live more than one year and this money can invest in another kind of job more safe or maybe in actions do you remember that you had action in this? No, I don't. We didn't lost $70,000. We were earning $70,000. But in the months... That's correct Claudia. That's correct. But you can't win money without doing any kind of investment. But I have a question in my life and I am not blame you, I am not just nothing. I only tell me in all these months you lose and don't win. So if we analyze not fighting as a couple with the hurt... You want that I go into my red truck and start my company? No, I... You have a dream that I only possible and... Lars, I don't want that you have something. Just because they won't do those I really was afraid for your health when I saw you. We... One thing, Claudia, we don't need to discuss things we already know. Please. You told me this... 20 times. Please don't repeat things that I know, Claudia. It doesn't bring us any places to talk the same words. Over and over and over again. I know my success, Black. You don't have to tell me that, Claudia. Please. Give me some value information. Don't express things I know already, Claudia. Please. Claudia, you have a nose there. You know you have a nose. Please, Claudia. This life is not easy, Claudia. This knee always over. This knee always over. This knee always over. This knee always over. I feel worried. Me too, Claudia. Me too. And you believe if I go into the red truck, all will be solved and you put a marketing and then all will be good. And the money will be... The house will be full of money. I can tell you one thing. What will happen? We will get more poor. That's the only thing we will have in the world. It's the big company who run this, Claudia. We can't be in the market. That's the way things are changing. You can't do nothing about it, Claudia. The sun goes down. You can't change it, Claudia. You saw how many money I had. You saw that I started and it was growing. I was growing good, Claudia. The problem was... I know what. There were two problems. I believed that I should do trade number two. Normally they go down and it was going very much down. Normally it goes up again. But this time it was continuing going down. That's my fault. That's fault number one. The fault number two was we put it. I should have taken one third of the money into the electronic pocket. Because with so much money earned. It's not a problem to take money out. And then all has been saved. That was nice. Yes. It's not like you should send me a lot of pictures or stuff and stuff. I think I can ask for a lot of money or what I should do or not. I could find a number and I could find a lot of money. I think it's a good idea that I can ask for a lot of money. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll have a little bit of it. Two flashbigas. How do we have flashbigas that's right over there? That's right. Yeah. I think it's a good idea to put it in the pocket. So, I'll put it in the pocket. Yeah. These are the things that I have to put in here. I have to put it in here and I want to put it in the pocket. No. Yeah, but I think I can find it. No. No. There are a lot of things that I should do in the future. The education of the organisation. There are some things that I can do in the future. I think it's a good idea. There are a lot of things that I can do in the future. So, these are traditional gas bottles that you just use in the household. You just have to put them in the gas bottle. Then you can use this 30 millibar. If that's what I have to do, if that's not what I have to do, then it's a high-tracks bottle. I'll put it in the bag and then you can install it. It's more complicated. It's more complicated than a gun. Yeah. No, but that's what I have to say. It's because I have to put it in the bag and put it in the bag. I have to find it now. I don't have any other choice. It's because of the equipment. It's typical, I write down what the instructions for the bag should be. I want to make it a bit easier to use. I can do it because I just have to put it in the bag. Yeah. Yeah. I just have to put it in the bag. We can do it. So. It's not a joke, but I'll put it in the bag. I'll put it in the bag and then you can put it in the bag. I'll put it in the bag and then you can put it in the bag. Yeah. Yeah, that's understandable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's understandable. No. No, no, no, no. We're going to put it in the bag. We're going to put it in the bag. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're going to put it in the bag. I think it's a bit easier to use. Yeah. But it's not a joke. Yeah. The next step is to put it in the bag. And then you have to put it in the bag. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but it's not a joke. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. But we have to put it in the bag. If you have a gun, you can put it in the bag. And then you put it in the bag. It's not a joke. We can put it in the bag. We're going to put it in the bag. So if you put it in the bag, you can put it in the bag. So you have to put it in the bag. Because it's a bag that can be used in the bag. It's not a bag that can be used in the bag. Yeah, but when you put it in the bag, it's a bit dirty. But the things that make this situation worse are the two guns that can be used together. So you can say if you put it in the bag, for example, a bag that I've put in, you can put it in the bag. But then it's a little bit dirty. So that's what it is. So you can say, if you can put it in the bag, you can put it in the bag. But if you put it in the bag, you can put it in the bag. I'll give you a little bit of a bag that I've put in the bag. And then you put it in the bag. Yeah. I have seen that. I have seen that. But I think you can express something before you know it. You know, there is no sound from the organization. And when you put it in the bag, you look at it and give it away. Then you say, okay, in this situation, yes, that's what it was like, I was like, if you can feel it, it's not good for you. Instead of going, yes, it's like that. Ui, h过 en lenn pائnskare, men altese rates kendert tradevarm tondbeantke svanderum,okus na dallo orbendri za treg n Prevention. 6. Men det har gått også til det, hvor også hudstændig har bliv. Og når du har en pær, men så er det heller ikke, så er det heller ikke, hvad du har en sige, de store problemer. Det bliver selvfølgelig lidt byrre, fordi der skal jo noget andet, elektriskudstyrer, og kan vi formføren til, fordi det er nogle større pensioner, der skal transporteres strømme med. Så der har det andet, vi kjænter det. Ja, men det igen, det kommer... Det kommer an på om Jeske trai teenien, og det er jo, det skal bruke en rope tavorm. Det er jo, det skal jo trai tomen, og det er jo i dag, det bliver jo en rope tavorm.
