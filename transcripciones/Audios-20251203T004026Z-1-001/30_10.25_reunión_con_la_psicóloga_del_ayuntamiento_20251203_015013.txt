 everything then you can get an under average average and over average so if you get a score that's an average then you have an average a functional level compared to children that's the same age when I look into your answers you answer that Juan Diego has a low total a low functional level in everyday life compared to his classmates and I think that's I understand why you have answered that in the questions and it tells me that he needs support there's nothing wrong with him he just needs support yeah the schools answers it puts him in this category that's very low yeah and to me I know it's not the same but they know that he needs help as well yeah this area or index so to speak you it was about the school the communication and controlling yourself you said he says he's under average so in this category and the school says very low so in school he needs a lot of support yeah so as well as home but it needs more support in school that's very normal then we have an area about the social ability and here you he's you place him in this category very low and so in school yeah sorry then we have the last topic that's about his practical and a being of ability so to speak it's about being out in traffic it's about taking care of yourself and so on and you place him in the very low category this question app doesn't fix anything for but it it describes him for yeah and the meaning about this paper is to make a judgment about if he has special needs or not and this question I can help me deciding that as well as your description and my observations in school Claudia you okay yeah do you need some tissue yeah I know it's hard to hear but I hope that we can help you and Juan Diego this paper making the judgment about and it's a little bit tricky but that if he needs help in over or under nine hours a week yeah and there's nothing it wasn't a hard decision for me it's very clear that he needs more than nine hours help or support a week and you need to that that's um he needs to have that to be in the school he is in now and I think it's very good that he's in that kind of school where they can help him and there's few students and a lot of teachers yeah and I wrote in this that he needs to be supported in his social cognitive behavior and that he needs a material that fits that fits his level you know in mathematics and in the English and Danish yeah it should fit him more than the average group yeah and I have also wrote that we need to support him in the social interaction with the other students because it looked like that he wants to interact with them but he needs help yeah he wants to have friends yeah I can see that is not easy because no no it is not but it looks like the other students in the classroom some of them reminds me of Juan Diego they have the same needs that he has and I think that's a good thing because maybe they understand each other and it's not it's good for him not to be the only one in the world with his needs yeah I have wrote that he needs visual support like the documents you send me because it's very clear that he needs visual support in not to draw he's very good at that but I think he uses less energy when he's visual supported than if we'd just talk with him yeah and then I wrote that he needs repetition if I explain something to him in in the in the English classes he needs a repetition to understand what we mean then I wrote that it's very important that the teachers are very clear and very you know concrete is it called that it's concrete in what they tell him they he doesn't need a lot of explanations it should be repeated but not different kinds of explanations specific specific exactly do you know that cloud yet specific yeah yeah and then I wrote that he needs a preparation to what he's gonna do tomorrow next week and he needs I'll try to say it and pronounce it predictability in Danish is predictively yeah just in the Spanish yeah exactly yeah I really think he needs that and right now he as I said he looks like he's glad of happy and it's a good school for him and I think it's important information when he's done being in this kind of school we kind of know what he needs in the future yeah and then I think this paper it can tell the people that's going to help him about that yeah so glad that this paper doesn't that doesn't fix anything for you over Juan de Ego but it is a description of what he needs for the people who can help yeah and yeah I have talked with Jacob about that when I have handed this for you I can send it to him per email and if he has any questions he can contact me yeah and then I would like to send it to the social workers well for example I am in those weeks near to my house or I think in different areas they are fixing that cross so doing some works and all the past transports you quit was affecting for example my boys normally take the bus for go to the school at 742 but now they are taking the bus 8 o'clock because I don't know what is happening but I'm worried because they are together they go together so José Carlos can support Juan de Ego but when they are come back at home we haven't any problem yet with Juan de Ego because he's taking the bus with the teachers but for example in the other case with my other boy José Carlos for example his and my mom I was waiting the bus at 224 and two days the bus never stopped okay the bus continued and I was there and you don't know because that bus don't enter and that next day when I was waiting outside the bus never stopped and he took another bus at 3 o'clock he finished 140 and the second bus lived him in other two kilometers from the home and I was thinking what will happen if this situation happened with Juan de Ego because I don't know José Carlos he can it sounds like he can solve the problem you know he can solve the bus problem but he can he knows what to do about calling you as soon but I'm not sure that Juan de Ego knows what to do when he meets the problem yeah yeah yeah I was with Juan de Ego some weeks ago in and footage yeah okay and I was looking something and I lost him for five seconds yeah because she continued walking yeah and he began to speak noise he said mama okay mama what are you but in this moment maybe the people that was around him what I am I in but I finally what can I do I and I saw him and I say I'm here yeah I am here the world yeah and when you're with him in physics it's I know it's outside but it's a safe place yes but we don't know what can happen other places or maybe he's alone exactly no I can I ask you a question when Claudia in physics was he looking on his phone yeah when he looks on his phone he don't know where he is in the phone yeah 100% okay he went to so there's maybe something to learn okay for me in they played football in the arena I don't know what to call in the school and there he didn't have his phone and to me it looked like he's in his own world even there without his phone but of course it's a thing that can be tricky he's more in his own world when he has his phone I think yes yeah but of course it's it's when he has his phone he can be going by a second yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he can be distracted by his phone but in the school he can be distracted the little folk of he has he used totally on the phone yeah then he don't know where he is but I also see in school that he is distracted without his phone you can see him in the school without the phone yeah I have they played football yeah okay yeah and there he was distracted by that there was other students by the side of the arena yeah so he was without his phone he don't use phone in the school he that it's your same with that because they have like we mean we think no no phone and when he take the bus he don't use the phone too because he I told him when they were nice I said him when they were pleased you can't use that because if you lost that stop bus you can go to another place and he's afraid for this yeah and he said I don't want to use my phone but okay but can't be happen and it's not yes I understand the phone but he have a problem yeah yeah he have a problem this is the reality and and I only want to find out this way yeah and when he's 18 years old my job isn't involved involved anymore because it's up till 18 years old and that's another reason why it's so important that the social worker is involved so they can help you and the educational guidance so you are not going to be when he's up 18 no no this is only from zero yes so to 18 years old because then you are an adult yeah yeah but as I said this paper doesn't fix anything but maybe it is a help by describing him yeah yeah yeah Claudia I would like to print this out to you and I would like to send it to Jacob and the social you Juan Diego Jacob the social worker and the educational I think that he needs a lot a lot of help with that language because yeah because when we haven't he have social and a problem with the communication social communication so is he having the language is a big problem because in my case for example I don't my English is intermediate so and I feel very bad when I can't express yeah all that I feel or all that I think and when the people makes me feel that they can't understand me or that I we can't communicate it that's me but I guess that what clapping with them with my boys yeah but Juan Diego can express him in English right yes yeah and maybe the Danish will come maybe not I know a lot of people in the spectrum and a lot of them likes to speak English a lot of them as English yeah not all of them of course but a lot of them likes to speak English but that doesn't mean he can't learn Danish but maybe he can learn Danish and I heard the the said a teacher by his side and they he he was reading Danish it was in another accent than than I'm using in Danish of course but it looked it looked like he yeah he did it with happiness reading Danish I'm not sure that he understood what he read but the teacher by his side translated some of the words from Danish to English so he knew what he was reading and that's a start in learning Danish yeah yeah yeah god yeah I will print this right now okay yeah and I wrote on the first page that he did Juan Diego doesn't have a CPI number yet no do you know when he will have that when he will get a CPI number in some months no maybe next year okay okay that's a long time but this system is not very fast so try to read it and though I'm only here for Juan Diego also he's 18 you can call me the next month it's so yeah of course you can and sometimes I talk with Jacob yeah I know Jacob so we can if if Juan Diego needs something I don't know what it should be because I think it's the right school but if you need something you can call me and then we can talk about it yeah you
