B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] But what we can do, so...
[00:07] I just asked.
[00:10] Yes.
[00:11] If you say it's not possible for you to learn, but did you ever speak with him about that
[00:20] or your life with other people, you have to show a little respect about others?
[00:30] I was skipping and I don't hear his, that you said that he was singing.
[00:37] So you don't believe?
[00:39] It's not about that if I believe.
[00:41] No.
[00:42] I didn't listen to him.
[00:44] No, no, no, no.
[00:45] You are not the same.
[00:46] Yeah.
[00:50] But what happened if he, for example, he is an out-distant spectrum.
[00:57] He has ecolalyas.
[01:00] He always repeats things or something that he has in his head and he is singing.
[01:07] It's not about that he don't respect.
[01:10] It's about situation, the condition.
[01:14] Did you ever try to explain it?
[01:18] Yes, we talked with him.
[01:20] I talked with Achikola, he used to use the therapies.
[01:24] And this is the name of this is Ecolalia.
[01:27] When you repeat something many times and we try.
[01:32] But it's not that he don't respect you.
[01:36] It's not about respect.
[01:43] I don't know.
[01:45] I just know if people never have been speaking that this is not a normal.
[01:53] How should they know?
[02:07] So to get the sleeping in this house we have to follow, he is written.
[02:12] He is what?
[02:14] His sleeping written.
[02:16] But when you went to sleep he was sleeping.
[02:21] Yeah.
[02:24] But then you don't understand what I say.
[02:27] Can you repeat this?
[02:30] Because I was like...
[02:31] If all the people need, let's say eight hours of sleep, quiet.
[02:37] We have to follow when he sleeps.
[02:41] Yeah. Because when he wakes up in the morning I want to sleep one hour more.
[02:45] He is lonely.
[02:47] And I can't sleep.
[02:55] And maybe some days you want to sleep a little extra in the morning like today maybe.
[03:01] But impossible.
[03:02] He's not been noisy last.
[03:04] We try to be a little truss.
[03:08] So now we are discussing that if it's true he was noisy in the morning and you were sleeping you couldn't hear it.
[03:19] Okay, so now we are back to the state of you don't believe what I say.
[03:24] It's not about this.
[03:26] But you say he was not noisy in the morning.
[03:32] How do you know that because you were sleeping?
[03:35] He called to the school to Monday to Friday and he's not disturbed you.
[03:41] I called you.
[03:43] I want to talk to you about this point.
[03:46] You say he is not noisy in the morning.
[03:49] How do you know that when you were sleeping?
[03:53] I didn't hear him.
[03:55] Okay, so you didn't know.
[03:57] I don't know.
[03:59] I was waking up because he was noisy.
[04:03] Okay.
[04:06] So do we need to continue to talk about if he was noisy or not?
[04:14] No.
[04:15] Okay, thank you.
[04:18] So you believe me?
[04:20] Thank you.
[04:22] Because if that situation is continuing that I have to make evidence about what I say is real.
[04:30] I close, close, yeah.
[04:33] Say no more.
[04:36] We had this discussion many times.
[04:39] I'm finished.
[04:41] No, no, no, no.
[04:43] But you don't.
[04:44] It's like I don't want to hear what you say.
[04:48] Maybe you don't say the reality.
[04:52] I'm not stupid yet, close, yeah.
[04:55] Anybody say no.
[04:57] I try to make it around.
[05:00] No.
[05:03] No.
[05:05] You do?
[05:07] It was the same one for.
[05:10] I only say that.
[05:12] It was the same one for.
[05:13] He is.
[05:14] You don't believe me.
[05:15] Then you ask him to say if it's true.
[05:19] No, Lars.
[05:20] I don't want any problem.
[05:23] No.
[05:25] But that is also showing me a little respect to just recognize what I say is actually true.
[05:34] Yeah.
