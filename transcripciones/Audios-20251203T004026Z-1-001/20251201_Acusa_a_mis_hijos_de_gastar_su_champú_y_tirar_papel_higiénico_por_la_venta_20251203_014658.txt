 I use a lot of paper because I enter each 30 minutes and I have to clean myself. But I'm not a lot of attention. So let me see this. There's nothing to say. Because it's fun and fun and long, and fun and we have one piece because there's a few here. I don't know when you want to use this, it's a string. But I wonder if there's going to be water here. And there was like this. Minimal. Minimal. Yeah, that's insane. This was for a long time and everybody was talking. Take your meal. And yesterday we were spying, and I said, I hope you don't need it. Because we have. But now we don't have it. And there's also happening something strange in this toilet paper outside the house. I pick up many times. Maybe someone is putting out of the windows. I don't know who. No, impossible. Anybody know that? No, okay, okay. So where is it coming from? No, because this is always close. The window. Yeah, but there's toilet in the outside. I don't know why. I pick up three times now. And I see now it's again. Maybe when that, I don't know, maybe when the camera's here, the bus for the trash, maybe some of the papers. Normally not. Yeah, but it's not the fault of my family. No, of course not. No, of course not. It's the ghost. Or maybe you. Yeah, of course.
