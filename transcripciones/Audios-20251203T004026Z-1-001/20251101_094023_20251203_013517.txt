 But what we can do, so... I just asked. Yes. If you say it's not possible for you to learn, but did you ever speak with him about that or is it possible for you to speak with him about that? I was sleeping and I don't hear his that you said that he was singing. So you don't believe? I... it's not about that if I believe. I know. I didn't listen to him. No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't have to say it. Yeah. But what happens if he, for example, he is an outstretched, outstretched, outstretched? He has ecolalyas. He always repeats things or something that he has in his head and he's singing. And this is not about that he don't respect. This is about a situation, the condition that he has. Did you ever try to explain it? Yes, we talked with him. I talked with Achikola, he used with the therapies and this is the name of this is Ecolalia. When you repeat something many times and we try. But it's not that he don't respect you. It's not about respect. I don't know. I just know if people never have been speaking that this is not a normal. How should they know? So to get the sleeping in this house we have to follow, he is written. He is what? His sleeping written. But when you went to sleep he was sleeping. Yeah. But then you don't understand what I say. Can you repeat this? Because I was like... If all the people need, let's say eight hours of sleep, quiet. We have to follow when he sleeps. Yeah. Because when he wakes up in the morning I want to sleep one hour more. He is lonely. And I can't sleep. And maybe some days you want to sleep a little extra in the morning like today maybe. But impossible. He's not been noisy last. We try to be a little truss. So now we are discussing that if it's true he was noisy in the morning and you were sleeping you couldn't hear it. Okay. So now we are back to the state of you don't believe what I say. It's not about this. But you say he was not noisy in the morning. How do you know that because you were sleeping? He called to the school to Monday to Friday and he's not disturbed you. I called you. I want to talk to you about this point. You say he is not noisy in the morning. How do you know that when you were sleeping? I didn't hear him. Okay. So you didn't know? I don't know. I was waking up because he was noisy. Okay. So do we need to continue to talk about if he was noisy or not? No. Okay. Thank you. So you believe me? Thank you. Because if that situation is continuing that I have to make evidence about what I say is real. I close, close, yeah. Say no more. We had this discussion many times. I'm finished. No, no, no. No, no, no. But you don't. It's like I don't want to hear what you say. Maybe you don't say the reality. I'm not stupid yet. Anybody say anything? No, but you try to make it around. No. You do? It was the same one for. I only say that. It was the same one for. He doesn't believe me. Then you ask him to say if it's true. No, Lars. I don't want any problem. No. But that is also showing me a little respect to just recognize what I say is actually true. Yeah.
