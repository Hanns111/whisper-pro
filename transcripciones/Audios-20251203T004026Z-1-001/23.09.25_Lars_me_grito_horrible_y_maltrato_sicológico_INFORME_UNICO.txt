B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] No, I only want to see what you see.
[00:24] You never learn who I am, Claudia. You don't listen to what I say.
[00:28] You don't listen to my feelings. You don't understand my points.
[00:35] You only want to hear me.
[00:37] Yes, but it's not a help. I do it all up anyway.
[00:41] No, because you say me and I am trying to teach me.
[00:45] Yes, this is something new for me.
[00:49] And I am trying to do my best.
[00:51] I am here. You say, do that, I do that.
[00:54] But I don't know why you are especially today only because you are coming.
[01:01] I don't know why, and it's not my fault.
[01:05] Maybe if I work all the day, run around in the shops, doing many things, maybe I am a little tired.
[01:13] Maybe it would be nice to have a wife who come home.
[01:17] I have been preparing the dinner for you, my love.
[01:21] But then you don't have to work anymore because you...
[01:25] I don't know, but I am cooking the rice and you say, why are you cooking the rice many foods?
[01:30] No, I don't say that. I don't say that.
[01:34] So, you... I understand that.
[01:37] I don't want, first of all, I explained you five million times.
[01:42] I don't want to eat late every day because it's...
[01:46] No, can I explain?
[01:48] When you eat late, I explain this many times before.
[01:52] Please don't talk nicely because we are not fighting.
[01:57] No, the rice is cooking too much.
[02:01] No, it's okay.
[02:03] Okay, one day they will burn and I will call the police.
[02:08] What you say, Dad, it's half-water.
[02:12] Yes, please.
[02:15] I have been cooking in 35 years.
[02:20] Yes, but you don't just cook rice.
[02:23] Me, I do always.
[02:27] So, I am 52 years and I can't cook rice.
[02:31] No, you do different.
[02:33] That's all, but the rice has water enough and you all...
[02:40] Do you play with flow?
[02:43] I am not doing nothing wrong.
[02:46] I would like to eat my evening dinner not very late because it's about healthy.
[02:53] Yes, you come in now if you want.
[02:56] Because I can live my own life if you want too.
[03:00] I don't want that.
[03:02] But you...
[03:03] I can make my own food five o'clock and then you can do whatever you want.
[03:07] You do it like that? Is that okay for you?
[03:10] I am not saying that, please.
[03:14] But when I come home, I do a lot of work all the day.
[03:21] And I want to hear too, clean and...
[03:24] Yeah, but I don't say you have to clean the floor every day.
[03:29] It's not me who say that.
[03:32] Yeah, but I want to help with this.
[03:35] So...
[03:37] So...
[03:40] You think it's the same?
[03:43] No.
[03:44] Do you have a plane in your back?
[03:46] I am not comparing, but why?
[03:49] I am not... I didn't have anything wrong.
[03:53] No, because you did? Nothing.
[03:59] I have to take care about what food we buy, what food we make.
[04:04] I have to propose five hundred years because I couldn't stay here.
[04:10] The last week I was cooking many days.
[04:14] But why do you say that?
[04:16] Why do you say all these things about me that I didn't know nothing?
[04:23] About the cooking?
[04:25] And I cooked the last week.
[04:27] Yes, but the last week is not today.
[04:29] Yeah, but...
[04:31] I was cooking the last 35 years.
[04:33] I was working 80 hours last week.
[04:36] Wait, last.
[04:38] For me, please understand.
[04:41] It's all a goal to learn to cook because you know me before and you always know that I don't know.
[04:50] But actually, it is not my problem that you can't cook.
[04:53] Yeah, but...
[04:57] Okay.
[04:59] Actually, it is not my problem, Claudine.
[05:01] I know.
[05:02] I know, but when things took toll, and you tell, and you don't eat your couple,
[05:08] like the thing we love is always different.
[05:12] But you are angry with me all the time.
[05:16] You don't understand what I say.
[05:19] I am working all the day.
[05:22] I am running in the self-spiting food.
[05:25] I am coming home. What's planned? Nothing.
[05:30] Because I don't know the Danish food.
[05:35] And you are not teaching me.
[05:39] Yeah, and now we are in the same place, like two hours ago, when we stand in this discussion.
[05:45] Nothing is happening.
[05:48] Only I am a big asshole.
[05:50] Now, that's the only thing different.
[05:54] I am a big asshole.
[06:00] I can't cook the rice.
[06:03] I don't say this.
[06:05] I never...
[06:06] Really, you take it out of my hands and put the water away.
[06:10] What? I am doing. I am trying to share.
[06:14] Yeah.
[06:17] I don't know what I am doing wrong, but if you feel that I am doing wrong, please forgive me.
[06:26] But anyway, this person can eat this.
[06:30] Okay, then I have to buy special food for this person.
[06:34] And no, I don't want this.
[06:36] And I have to buy special food for this person.
[06:39] And we can eat the potatoes.
[06:41] We eat rice.
[06:44] This is only one.
[06:47] If you have all those problems with the food, I think you should take more action about what food can this family eat.
[06:55] Because you are three members. I am only one.
[06:58] And we are very grateful with your hands.
[07:02] Really.
[07:05] Are we...
[07:10] The internet is one big open book.
[07:15] You can read every food.
[07:18] You can't, as 84 years old, you can't say, I can't cook.
[07:25] It's the same as going up in the morning saying, I can't go to work today.
[07:30] I don't want to.
[07:33] I am trying. I am learning.
[07:36] Okay? I am learning.
[07:49] I can give you the money. You can go to the siop sonry, whatever you want.
[07:54] I try to do with the money we have.
[07:58] The best opportunities.
[08:01] When you were sleeping outside, I was cooking.
[08:08] Was you expecting that I was riding home?
[08:11] No.
[08:12] To cook for you?
[08:13] No.
[08:14] No.
[08:15] That is the reality. Impossible.
[08:18] I did.
[08:20] Yes?
[08:22] Okay.
[08:25] I don't want any discussion, please.
[08:28] It's because it's when we feel bad.
[08:31] Yeah?
[08:34] I can have my bag and work 7 hours.
[08:39] I really think that feels.
[08:58] How many of the potatoes here do you think your family will go into it?
[09:16] Then I will eat the potatoes.
[09:19] You are going to eat?
[09:21] We don't eat a lot.
[09:23] No. That's why I ask specific how many?
[09:28] Five for day, those each one.
[09:31] Then we eat.
[09:32] Then we have to take a compilation of how many potatoes we need to eat and take them away from this place.
[09:39] Yes.
[09:40] Into a glass bowl.
[09:42] Or tell me why I want to do my own health.
[09:48] Do you choose what do you are going to eat?
[09:53] I take you.
[09:54] Yes.
[09:55] I like to eat rice in order.
[09:57] Yeah, but you choose.
[09:58] I told you that in order.
[09:59] You choose what do you want to eat?
[10:02] Potatoes.
[10:03] Yes.
[10:04] Yes.
[10:05] I want to eat potatoes.
[10:06] Yeah, but also.
[10:08] Bon.
[10:13] You want to eat this?
[10:14] No.
[10:15] I ask if this is enough for the family.
[10:18] I say, you choose what do you want to eat?
[10:24] I want to eat you.
[10:26] Or you do and I can put, okay, I'm going to put what can we are going to eat because of you?
[10:34] Yes.
[10:35] I can't put it.
[10:37] Honey, what?
[10:39] I don't want to have a discussion about fucking potatoes.
[10:44] Yeah, for prison.
[10:47] Well, the three are going to eat this.
[10:50] Yeah.
[10:51] And you, how many of you?
[10:54] When you look on my plate every evening.
[10:57] You never do that?
[10:59] I don't look.
[11:00] Never?
[11:01] No, I don't.
[11:02] Just to look.
[11:03] You never seen on my plate in an evening dinner?
[11:07] Yeah, this is enough.
[11:09] That's okay.
[11:11] It depends on how many you take.
[11:14] Now I am sure that you're in for enough.
[11:17] Of course, we have the vegetables too.
[11:19] Yeah.
[11:20] I want to put this in the microwave.
[11:25] Fantastic.
[11:26] Sure, I want some discussion for you.
[11:30] No, no.
[11:31] After working seven hours going through the same table, I want to be very perfect in the day.
[11:37] I'm very happy.
[11:39] I promise that I don't want these.
[11:42] I don't want these.
[11:44] I just want to do this.
[11:49] Okay.
[12:19] Of course, sitting there is not making food.
[12:40] We are not going to have the evening dinner sitting on the S.
[12:47] That's right.
[12:50] So someone has to do something in this family.
[12:54] And that would be me.
[13:04] So, someone has to do something in this family.
[13:07] And that would be me.
[13:08] So, someone has to do something.
[13:15] And that would be me.
[13:25] This is not the size of each two to three yards.
[13:30] No, because someone has to do something.
[14:31] Now you can help me do this because the magazine is very soon ready.
[14:37] I told you.
[14:40] So, it is done.
[14:45] And if it's for me, we are going to do it quickly.
[14:49] You can cook.

[22:20] Next.
[22:23] and you don't care.
[22:25] Don't take that slow.
[22:29] Then I'll just completely stew with man.
[22:53] And if it's a problem with the cleaning and the cooking and the...
[23:13] ...then anything I can do for my own bad washing.
[23:16] I can do all alone with all.
[23:19] You don't need to do anything for me.
[23:26] It's very, very, very simple for me to do that.
[23:37] I just do it my way.
[23:43] I just do it my way.
[24:13] Like said, you could prepare the potatoes.
[24:20] You know we need potatoes every day for the cooking.
[24:31] And I was cooking the...
[24:34] ...the old days.
[24:37] You could use...
[24:39] ...and other days, now it's two days.
[24:42] Two days, I did and yesterday you.
[24:45] And this is the...
[24:46] ...a couple...
[24:48] ...is here.
[24:50] Okay?
[24:51] And I did two days ago and you did yesterday.
[24:54] Maybe you want to eat nine o'clock in the evening.
[24:57] I don't want to eat nine o'clock in the evening.
[24:59] Yes.
[25:00] It's 6.51.
[25:02] Yes.
[25:03] We can eat something.
[25:04] In my opinion, we should have been finished eating now.
[25:08] A long time ago.
[25:15] Because it's not empty.
[25:17] And I have a problem with my stomach in the moment.
[25:20] But now is however responsibility.
[25:22] Now you are bringing for now.
[25:24] No, no, no, because we have two hours of discussion.
[25:27] But we're discussing.
[25:29] But I was happy.
[25:32] Yes, yes.
[25:33] No, I can go again.
[25:34] Then you can't do it again.
[25:38] I can sleep in other place.
[25:41] It's not a problem.
[25:42] You must have it for me.
[25:44] Anybody?
[25:45] I do please.
[25:47] Please, please.
[26:03] Now see they are cooking, starting on seven.
[26:08] And then you go down to five.
[26:11] And when they have this color and you feel this is not enough because they are soft.
[26:16] But this color is the right position.
[26:19] Not too much, not too little.
[26:22] We understand.
[26:24] And then you have to have margarine enough.
[26:28] And when you turn them around now, they need more margarine because they will absorb it.
[26:35] And make it down because they are cold.
[26:40] We need a little more temperature to the next one minute or something.
[26:45] Because when you do need, you don't cook meat.
[26:51] You fry meat.
[26:54] You have to have a temperature more than 100 degrees because you don't want to cook meat.
[27:04] You want to fry meat.
[27:08] And you see the can is to see more cold here in this side.
[27:27] So I turn them into the center.
[27:32] It's more cooked and here than I turn like this.
[27:36] And you see the color is less.
[27:59] Now you see the temperature is low.
[28:02] You should put more power in a moment because when you never, it has not to cook but to fry.
[28:25] And in a moment you can feel and see that everything is frying.
[28:29] You go down again.
[28:36] That's why I say cooking is about a feeling.
[28:42] Like all the things is a balance in this life between all.
[28:49] And I am learning that is the important control of the emotions too.
[28:59] And the BI was here.
[29:03] Sometimes it is too much for a human.
[29:07] But I didn't have to wrong and you can see it.
[29:10] And you are working the place with the knife and go.
[29:18] I didn't hit you.
[29:21] Maybe you want to report with the police.
[29:24] This time too.
[29:27] I am only trying to say what is to do with you.
[29:32] Or you don't need to find out.
[29:35] No, I'm just keeping on thinking about you.
[29:38] I don't want to explain my life.
[29:42] Oh, oh, oh, it's a nightmare for me to explain every day.
[29:47] Why?
[29:49] How?
[29:54] My life is very, very simple without problems.
[29:58] You have a bad feeling and you can't do it.
[30:01] No.
[30:04] You didn't prepare anything.
[30:10] No plants.
[30:12] I'm working all the day coming home to take all the responsibility to buy food, to prepare food, cook food, clean.
[30:22] I think.
[30:24] Yeah, yeah, okay.
[30:26] You think I do nothing?
[30:30] We can't eat cleaning.
[30:40] And now I am an asshole.
[30:44] The world's biggest asshole in the world.
[30:48] Of course I say that I'm a pinner.
[30:52] Bad man.
[30:59] I'm a pinner.
[31:06] I'm a pinner.
[31:13] I'm a pinner.
[31:18] I'm a pinner.
[31:23] This is a feeling.
[31:31] I could feel this one and this one.
[31:35] There's a big difference.
[31:37] I could feel it.
[31:40] I could feel it with your hands.
[31:44] Push a little.
[31:45] See, it's very soft.
[31:48] This is more hard.
[31:50] This is because this one we put on as the last one.
[31:57] This one is all over red because it's out now.
[32:02] That's why I say again, cooking is not about minutes.
[32:07] It's about a feeling.
[32:12] So, how do you want the food to be?
[32:19] It's about a feeling.
[32:21] Now it would be good that the rice was finished because this is finished.
[32:26] And the potatoes.
[32:28] And now, in the same time, we can wait for the potatoes.
[32:33] And we can eat.
[32:47] And then we can eat.
[32:53] And then we can eat.
[33:00] And then we can eat.
[33:05] And then we can eat.
[33:12] And then we can eat.
[33:19] And then we can eat.
[33:27] And then we can eat.
[33:33] And then we can eat.
[33:40] And then we can eat.
[33:47] And then we can eat.
[33:54] And then we can eat.
[34:01] And then we can eat.
