[00:21] Donald Seymour
[00:33] Bu هذا étant schönfer.
[00:37] Bu هذا …
[00:45] Du heating and blossoms on the??
[00:47] ah …
[00:50] Air todazio para windy et c�� ?
[00:52] Why?
[00:53] Because...
[00:55] Claudia.
[00:57] Because we take up promotion
[01:00] and it's 90 the first three months.
[01:03] Yeah.
[01:04] But Claudia,
[01:06] it's waste of time discussing if this is right or not, if it is right.
[01:13] What I try to say is that
[01:15] there's many things Claudia.
[01:18] Okay.
[01:19] We have to do something.
[01:20] Yeah, we can change another form.
[01:27] I try to let you understand the situation.
[01:39] So...
[01:42] and sitting here and drinking coffee will not solve the problem.
[01:48] We have to take some decisions.
[01:50] We have to do something.
[01:53] And this is not small changes we have to do.
[02:00] The investment they make a plan
[02:03] and they finished calculating every Sunday.
[02:08] Now they earned 140%.
[02:13] Claudia.
[02:14] Mm-hmm.
[02:17] Do you understand what I say?
[02:20] This is your...
[02:21] You are talking about your trade.
[02:23] Yeah.
[02:24] Okay.
[02:25] Mm-hmm.
[02:28] I don't see any other way, can't I?
[02:33] But we have to find some money to do the trading.
[02:37] Mm-hmm.
[02:46] I don't see any other way, Claudia.
[02:53] I already tried to talk with two of my friends
[02:59] if it was possible that they could give me some money.
[03:02] And then in December I get some money from my mother.
[03:06] And I could give them back.
[03:09] The people they say now, they make a story that they don't have the money.
[03:14] But it's not true.
[03:24] I don't know what you think, but I...
[03:31] I have been analyzing if I am thinking correct, Claudia.
[03:36] If I am being focused, I'm all.
[03:45] It's running away from us, Claudia.
[04:01] Yeah.
[04:02] Then I have been thinking about I could also sell something, the green machine.
[04:08] Mm-hmm.
[04:11] The most important thing is actually to do it as quick as possible.
[04:16] Yeah.
[04:22] I also think about selling the red color.
[04:34] I don't like it.
[04:38] I just don't know what to do, Claudia.
[04:48] I have maybe...
[04:51] I have to call another person I ask if this is possible for him.
[04:56] And I think they say no.
[05:02] And I don't feel comfortable inside when I can't see there is a solution
[05:07] for the future.
[05:10] It's okay to be a little down, and you have a solution.
[05:15] But keep on going down and don't have a solution.
[05:20] It makes me feel I can't accept.
[05:28] And we are there now.
[05:32] You need to analyze about the trait, your loss, and your losing that is that one's way.
[05:43] But you need to analyze that.
[05:46] I did all my thinking.
[05:53] About the mobile, we talk at the beginning that we can stay three months with this company and after change.
[06:12] So we are on time to change.
[06:17] I remember that promotion.
[06:20] The first three months was 90 or 99.
[06:25] Corona is around 100 Corona for person.
[06:30] I am going to be responsible for that.
[06:47] And I know that you are going to find a way.
[06:56] I have never been in this situation in Claudia.
[07:04] Yeah.
[07:08] Maybe you are two nirbles and stress because you lost a lot of money.
[07:25] Of course, I am with strength.
[07:31] But it's also that now I have bills, I should pay, I can't.
[07:37] Because you haven't done a month, the bad tips.
[07:41] No.
[07:44] Because you lost that.
[07:47] No, no, no.
[07:49] Because this is not a solution.
[07:51] Yes.
[07:53] The solution is try to find something to do.
[07:59] I can show you the picture.
[08:03] I don't know if you don't.
[08:06] No, I believe in all your words.
[08:09] Believe and it is true and it is possible.
[08:30] You can look here, Claudia again.
[08:36] I have seen this so many times, Claudia.
[08:43] The problem, yeah, I do not know.
[08:49] You know about this.
[08:51] I don't know about this.
[08:54] It's not my knowledge.
[09:25] I understand that all this is stressful.
[09:33] But I am sure that you are going to find the solution too.
[09:38] Because you are not an adjunct man, you are an intelligent man.
[09:48] I know.
[09:52] When I say I am very hard to do the limit, Claudia.
[09:58] People bless you, listen to me.
[10:11] I want to be happy, I want to smile, I want to have a little freedom.
[10:16] I want to be happy.
[10:46] I want to be happy.
[11:17] I want to be happy.
[11:22] I want to be happy.
[11:27] I want to be happy.
[11:31] I want to be happy.
[11:36] Of course I am sad that all this is happening also for you, Claudia.
[11:43] But the last year there has been many, many extra things.
[12:06] And no luck with almost anything.
[12:36] I don't believe in any other way.
[12:55] And I mean it, Claudia.
[12:57] Any other way will just...
[13:02] We will never.
[13:05] Maybe you can help you or someone in or your sister.
[13:13] I don't know what to say.
[13:19] I am going to continue studying.
[13:22] Actually my sister was very angry when I told her that I have a problem.
[13:30] How do you think it's me she said?
[13:37] Her.
[13:52] My little sister, she has a lot of money, but I know she will not help me.
[13:58] No, no.
[14:01] Maybe you can't talk with her.
[14:04] Impossible.
[14:07] It's the same as asking for a good for my money.
[14:10] Try to do that to Claudia.
[14:17] I know I did many mistakes, Claudia.
[14:27] So I don't know what to do, Claudia.
[14:49] I can try to see if I can find the people who give me the money.
[14:56] If that's not success, I have to say something.
[15:01] With value here.
[15:09] I am trying to buy things for food, for me and the children.
[15:24] For example, like yesterday.
[15:27] And other things.
[15:31] Because I know.
[15:34] Now I have a limit because I am not working.
[15:39] So my credit card is having support me.
[15:47] But I am trying to do my best.
[15:51] I am studying and when I am in someone, I am going to have the permission.
[16:00] And I am going to go to the job center to try to find a job.
[16:07] So I am on the way.
[16:31] Because I continue studying English by myself and Danish by myself in the computer.
[16:38] So I think that I am doing the correct things on the way for all the strips.
[16:47] No, but I want to say that you are not alone.
[16:53] And I am doing step by step for work too.
[17:00] And always we can find a solution.
[17:05] Always, ours.
[17:08] And I understand that you want to try to invest in this opportunity that you show me.
[17:15] But you haven't had money now for that.
[17:20] And I understand that you feel stressful for that.
[17:25] But what happens if someone gives you the money and you lose the money again?
[17:33] You are going to have to be more stressful because you are using a money for another person.
[17:42] And you can lose that because it is a big risk.
[17:46] And in December I will get the money from my mother.
[17:53] Yeah.
[17:56] Well.
[17:58] And I know what you say, Claudia.
[18:01] I am worried for that.
[18:03] But do you know about these things I don't?
[18:12] It's very easy. If you are small with a little amount, you don't earn only a little.
[18:18] If you start with a big amount, you earn very quickly a lot.
[18:22] And you can take money out.
[18:26] That's how it is.
[18:31] The most important thing is to get started with as high amount as possible.
[19:02] Mark of more coffee.
[19:24] Dude.
[19:26] ...i don't know if you understand me, i don't know if you respect my way of...
[19:45] ...i understand.
[19:46] ...i try to analyze all and finally you have to take some decisions, some conclusions,
[19:55] some... you need... i need to do something, because sitting here drinking coffee, looking out the window,
[20:07] is not a solution.
[20:10] ...and what is your plan?
[20:13] ...i already told you, Clownia.
[20:15] ...yeah.
[20:16] ...i don't see any other way.
[20:18] ...i think maybe if you don't find the money for other person, you...
[20:24] ...i think maybe sell something, this is that you...
[20:28] ...say it me.
[20:30] ...i am already...
[20:36] ...maybe i take the pictures after i'm seen today and put it on marketplace.
[20:41] ...because with this money...
[20:48] ...we can relax.
[20:52] ...i can start the invest.
[20:56] ...we can go up.
[20:59] ...and if we go up, i can buy another machine.
[21:14] ...just i don't want to get rid of the machine.
[21:25] ...but...
[21:28] ...you have been another solution.
[21:32] ...if not in reality.
[21:37] ...if you analyze all the possibilities and you consider that it's the only way...
[21:44] ...i don't believe i can find work for the company and earn enough money, Clownia.
[21:50] ...i don't believe.
[21:52] ...i tried this in some fucking hell many years, Clownia.
[21:57] ...okay.
[22:03] ...tried to call to the man who would give you work.
[22:07] ...maybe he have something.
[22:14] ...no, okay.
[22:18] ...and that's it.
[22:24] ...yeah.
[22:27] ...and that's it.
[22:32] ...and that's it.
[22:36] ...and it's the whole thing.
[22:41] ...and that's it.
[23:14] Tegna vu si
[23:39] ...i think about it.
[23:58] ...i think there's a lot of things that takes my time
[24:05] ...and my energy
[24:10] ...and my energy
[24:15] ...how much do you think that you can't get for this cream machine?
[24:21] It depends on if I want to do the daily quick, or we have a little more time.
[24:31] Around...
[24:34] ...$10,000, $12,000.
[24:40] ...and $10,000.
[24:43] ...and $10,000.
[25:04] I don't know what to say, because
[25:08] ...it's your machine, but for other size you want to invest in this, the trading,
[25:23] ...but you know that there are some risks, so it's a very hard decision.
[25:32] If there was one here, right now, with $12,000, I say,
[25:40] ...go.
[25:51] That's my sister, say, it's only material things.
[25:57] Who said that, Lisa?
[26:02] ...
[26:25] Please, for my side, tell me how can I do
[26:29] ...to allow the mobile children's mobile phone?
[26:42] I don't know how your economy is, I don't know how much hands are supporting you with the company,
[26:49] ...but you know I pay
[26:52] ...
[26:55] ...$3000,000, to write it every month?
[27:02] Hands send me first of all, he is...
[27:09] ...his work is like an assistant, a calm assistant.
[27:16] So, his salary is a few.
[27:23] And he said me around the amount that he can only pay is around the value of 800 coronas.
[27:35] For balls, because we have another situation in my country,
[27:45] ...the salary is not the same of here, it's an other world.
[27:52] And I am trying to...
[27:58] ...to do, but he said me that he was trying to get some money for...
[28:08] ...come to visit to the children, but it's not going to be possible, so he decided for this side.
[28:15] To buy the ticket for the concert for José Carlos with this little money and for go to Copenhagen.
[28:24] Because his reality, if you think that you have a bad situation, he is down.
[28:34] But I am thinking that when I will begin to work, it's going to be changed all.
[28:43] Because I am going to have an economy and help.
[28:47] But the situation is also, we are here now, Clarence.
[28:57] I am put into a situation where I am economically responsible for five people.
[29:05] That is the reality.
[29:07] We talk a lot about this before trouble.
[29:16] I know about the two children, I have my own.
[29:19] Yes, it was a change in my situation.
[29:23] And in the same time, I don't get the money from the local government for my own children.
[29:29] The support this way, I also lost those money as an income.
[29:34] So, actually, it's maybe three thousand a month.
[29:43] Five thousand a month, I lost.
[30:04] And I am very sad about all this.
[30:07] And I know inside me, I feel shame and I feel a lot of shit.
[30:14] But what can I do?
[30:18] I feel shame.
[30:21] And I am very sad about all this.
[30:25] And I know, inside me, I feel shame and I feel a lot of shit.
[30:31] But what can I do?
[30:39] I don't know how is the job here in Denmark.
[30:45] But if you go to the job center, do you have some possibilities?
[30:48] And it is?
[30:54] To go to the job center for me is, you may be eating.
[31:01] Is what?
[31:02] You may be eating.
[31:03] Why?
[31:12] It's not easy to explain to Claudia.
[31:18] It's not easy to explain.
[31:21] It's not easy to explain.
[31:25] I feel shame.
[31:28] I feel shame.
[31:32] But what can I do?
[31:36] I feel shame.
[31:40] It's not easy to explain.
[31:43] I feel shame.
[31:56] And the other side, I could try to recall the bank and say blah blah blah.
[32:03] I am 99% sure what they will say.
[32:09] Nope.
[32:13] And even that makes the situation worse because then the bank will start knowing something.
[32:43] And I feel shame.
[32:57] It's not a normal situation for me Claudia.
[33:01] I had many hard times in my life and fighting a little with the economy.
[33:09] But I always have the ability to use a little money.
[33:13] Save.
[33:15] Do a low budget.
[33:17] Do my own bread.
[33:20] Etc. Etc.
[33:23] And then with a little time I always arrived.
[33:29] Now rich.
[33:33] But I can't.
[33:36] This is not now.
[33:38] Now which going?
[33:40] Down.
[33:50] And yes, it is maybe my own fault.
[33:57] In many ways.
[35:02] So you need a little time to think about all this.
[35:12] And what do you think?
[35:15] No, I think that if you think that you are going to be a little bit more than you are going to be.
[35:22] And you are going to be a little bit more than you are going to be.
[35:26] So you need a little time to think about all this.
[35:30] And what do you think?
[35:33] No, I think that if you consider that you need to sell something, I am going to respect your decision.
[35:52] You...
[35:55] I...
[36:01] I understand you.
[36:04] This is a stressful situation and I am sure that we are going to find a way.
[36:12] I am not sure.
[36:15] I am very, very, very afraid of coming here.
[36:20] I understand very, very sad.
[36:50] But in reality, what can I do?
[36:55] I only can stay with you and give you my emotional support because I can't do another thing.
[37:20] I understand that you need a little time to think about all this.
[37:27] And what do you think?
[37:32] I understand that you need a little time to think about all this.
[37:38] And what do you think?
[37:43] I understand that you need a little time to think about all this.
[37:50] And what do you think?
[37:55] I understand that you need a little time to think about all this.
[38:02] But it's important that we can talk and we know what's going on and we can accept.
[38:09] Yes.
[38:11] Because...
[38:13] I am accepting.
[38:15] Claudia, I have no energy left for fighting.
[38:18] Yes.
[38:20] And any is fighting?
[38:22] I am very...
[38:26] I am in a situation as I...
[38:33] This is not a life for me.
[38:40] This is no life for me.
[38:47] And I don't want to be that person.
[39:00] For me and the people around me looking at me.
[39:14] I understand.
[39:21] People then run away from me.
[39:51] I understand.
[39:58] I understand.
[40:05] I understand.
[40:12] I understand.
[40:19] I understand.
[40:27] I understand.
