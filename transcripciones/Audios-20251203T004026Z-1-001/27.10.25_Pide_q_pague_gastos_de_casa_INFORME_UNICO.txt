B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] Okay.
[00:30] I called my vision company. I go to them to a meeting today. That's not the one thing.
[00:50] I want to try to see to help me. Maybe I pay a little too much tax money in. We can stop to pay more tax for this year or get something back.
[01:05] I have to look on that. I get a little salary from my own company to my private account every month. But the company do not earn money.
[01:23] I can't keep on doing that. Because then I have to put the money back again into the account. I just pay more tax.
[01:38] We are going to have a meeting with this. Try to make the best solution with that. That's number one info.
[01:48] Number two info. I called my bank. I didn't tell them everything. I just told him that in December my mother gave us, you can see, she did the last two years.
[02:04] We will have again. It's the same bank. I ask him what can we talk about. He can give me an extra bracket of 50,000 Danish owner.
[02:28] 25 on my private account and 25 on my company account.
[02:42] With the 50,000 I can have them in 45 days. Then I will get hopefully my mother's money.
[03:00] Let's say I didn't pay 10,000 for bills. We have 40 left. I am going to put those money into the investments.
[03:20] If I calculate 40,000 with the investments like it, that was too quickly for me.
[03:38] I have one to wash my clothes.
[04:02] If I am going to invest 40,000, I only use 25% of the 40,000.
[04:31] I have to actually trade with that. Those 10,000 will be a profit for one week of 140%.
[04:49] After one week, the total will be 24,000.
[05:15] This is the scenario we had this week. This week was not especially good.
[05:33] It's only a question.
[05:43] I don't know about this. If you consider that this is the way, but the banks are set.
[05:53] They don't know I do this year. I don't know. But they accept to give me more credit.
[06:03] In 45 days. I have to credit it in 45 days and then my mother's money arrives.
[06:29] I don't know.
[06:49] I don't know.
[07:17] I don't know. I will say that I am still 10,000.
[07:31] I am still 10,000.
[08:01] I am still 10,000.
[08:21] I am still 10,000.
[08:49] The profit of doing this investment with 10,000, is 14,000.
[09:13] If we have this salary, we don't go this way.
[09:37] I don't know.
[09:57] Can you see this?
[10:23] I know what you think. There are two ways to earn money in this life.
[10:37] I will be able to get this kind of income for work one week.
[10:53] I understand how you say.
[11:13] I don't know.
[11:23] I consider all the risks and you have the control.
[11:43] I can give you all the time my emotional support because I want the best for you for us.
[11:59] Always. I don't want to see you sad. I don't want to see you nervous.
[12:07] If I don't do anything now, I don't know what will happen with me.
[12:21] When I look all around me and think in reality,
[12:39] there is no better solution than this.
[12:53] The only thing is that I need to do this trading.
[13:07] I will start and be very specific and follow this here.
[13:23] Now you can laugh at me.
[13:33] If I can sit here and be focused and have my time, I am sure this here will be happening.
[13:43] If you look at this number and say, this is the most important.
[14:03] I have to go out and repair a little thing and earn 100 kong.
[14:19] Do you understand?
[14:29] I need my space to say now it's 3 o'clock. I have to stay here.
[14:45] If you need to cook, you need to do this because I don't want to fight about this here.
[15:05] I want you to understand. I understand.
[15:11] Let's take an example. One day I sit here, push the buttons, two traits.
[15:27] We make money. Of course we do.
[15:37] If I go out to do a little service, I earn only a little.
[15:45] If I am focused here.
[15:51] Do you understand?
[15:53] Yes, and I have a question.
[15:55] What do you expect about me?
[15:58] I can't do that because I always respect your time.
[16:06] If you need extra help, I can only wish that you be calm.
[16:14] The thing is that I don't want to take as much control and risk control as ever possible.
[16:26] That requires that when they give me the system, now it's time.
[16:30] I am going to go sit here.
[16:34] Look, follow. Is it going correctly?
[16:40] If I see something going wrong, I can stop it because I am focused here.
[16:46] I am not standing out there drinking coffee or away.
[16:52] The market, you see, it goes.
[16:58] I can't do two hours of cooking when I don't know what's happening here with my money.
[17:06] I invest with my risk.
[17:12] Do you think we can agree about this without looking with bad eyes?
[17:22] Of course.
[17:24] You know that I am doing my best.
[17:28] I am just trying to be very honest that for me it's also about what I feel.
[17:41] Let's say another thing out here, if you were not here and I knew I have to do this,
[17:51] then I will just take a little bread and put something on place here and drink my coffee and eat.
[17:57] I don't care because this is my work, this is my money, this is no.
[18:05] I have the opportunities.
[18:08] If I don't push the button the right time,
[18:17] it's like going to work without an early and early salary.
[18:25] And the situation with our economy is going like this now.
[18:33] And this is the surface. We need to change this country.
[18:41] Really.
[18:44] But I don't want.
[18:47] I want that you know what's going on.
[18:49] I want to know that we can make this agreement. That's how it is.
[19:04] My instant, I respect.
[19:08] So of course if there is calling me can you go to do a little job for me here and I can do that before 3 o'clock?
[19:17] I will do that of course and take those money too.
[19:24] But I will not because this here I earn 10 times more with my time investment.
[19:33] I understand you.
[19:39] I am doing my things. I am trying to do my aunt's things.
[19:46] That's good too, Claudia.
[19:49] Because you need your time. I need my time.
[19:52] But that's not means that we can share time together when you come and when I come.
[19:58] Right now we have an economy can situation. We have to take very seriously.
[20:04] And then this is priority number one.
[20:10] When I say share I don't say spend money.
[20:14] I say share maybe. But I respect. I am totally ready with you.
[20:20] I have many things to do here.
[20:23] I want, for example, I go with the computer to the second floor because I want to study.
[20:30] I want to do a speak. I can sit in the table in Juan Diego's room.
[20:38] And I can study quite and calm.
[20:43] I don't need to stay in front of you when you are doing this because maybe you disturb me and I disturb you.
[20:50] But in the start when I did this here there was an obligation on me that I should buy the food.
[20:59] I should do all the food in the same time I have to do the trading.
[21:02] And it was impossible for me to do that.
[21:05] And now it's not necessary because now I can cook.
[21:12] So I am happy because each day I am giving a little step more.
[21:22] I do it for my own, for my own dessert.
[21:29] I cook and I can continue doing that because today this was a goal for me.
[21:39] Because now I can learn.
[21:43] Of course you can cook.
[21:46] Yes, of course and I am doing.
[21:48] Because you have two hands.
[21:50] Yes.
[21:51] You have eyes, you have ears.
[21:53] Yes.
[21:54] So of course you can.
[21:56] People who say they can't do, I say holy Christ.
[22:00] Yes, but I am doing.
[22:03] I am happy because I am doing.
[22:07] The problem is that the time when the sickness is coming is around.
[22:14] You know how it is three o'clock and maybe two eleven.
[22:19] And that's how it is.
[22:25] But I prefer to do this because I know there is money in this and there is a lot of money.
[22:33] I can't work the same money out in the reality.
[22:40] It's impossible.
[22:43] And I will not, if I work with my back, 80 hours, you saw me working.
[22:49] Taking templates every day.
[22:51] It's not, I like my work.
[22:55] But this, this here.
[22:58] And I have been looking on this here, Claudia.
[23:03] Thank you for sharing your feelings.
[23:06] Thank you for sharing what are you thinking?
[23:10] And thank you for sharing what is your plan?
[23:14] Because I understand it.
[23:17] And we have now an agreement about this.
[23:21] I am going to respect your time.
[23:25] I have to do two things here.
[23:30] And this is my 50% in this house.
[23:36] Maybe it's 80% now in a time, Claudia.
[23:40] I can't do it.
[23:43] For example, I have...
[23:45] First of all, we have to agree that this here is the most highest priority because...
[23:50] Without this.
[23:52] And when do you think that you can be able to do that?
[23:57] From...
[24:01] Hopefully tomorrow.
[24:04] But tomorrow I have to go to a election meeting.
[24:10] I only have a question because now you say that you are very busy.
[24:17] That means that the appointment that I have is possible that I go along.
[24:23] I can't remember what time it was.
[24:26] Three o'clock, 30 October.
[24:31] But maybe I will have my phone woke.
[24:36] We can do like that.
[24:39] Or maybe if you have to do this three o'clock,
[24:46] maybe only you can leave me there and I can come back on the bus.
[24:52] Because I was looking at the bus.
[24:56] I can just stay.
[24:58] I just need...
[25:00] I can do it from my phone too.
[25:05] If I have to, but normally I would like to sit here with the control, the electricity.
[25:14] So nothing is going wrong.
[25:16] I sit here quiet.
[25:18] Or is organized.
[25:20] I look...
[25:22] Instead of sitting in a room with a stress and what's going on and what will happen if I lose the power from the telephone.
[25:31] For that reason, I would like that we have an agreement about this day.
[25:37] Because you are not going to be focused with your mobile.
[25:42] So maybe the best solution, because I want to be considering.
[25:52] That maybe...
[25:57] I have to wait for Juan Diego.
[26:01] Because he arrived to 10th, a clock, the bus.
[26:09] I can wait for him.
[26:11] He entered.
[26:12] I prepared all for his class.
[26:15] Maybe you can leave me before 3.
[26:18] I can wait.
[26:20] But you can come back at home before 3 o'clock.
[26:25] And I can wait there.
[26:27] And I can go by myself to the bus and come back in the bus.
[26:32] Maybe I can back around 5 o'clock because the last bus I was looking.
[26:38] It's also possible that I can drive for you, Claudia.
[26:42] Don't worry for me.
[26:44] It will help me to be more independent.
[26:47] Let me do that.
[26:50] And I can talk about that when we...
[26:53] I am the situation, because it's not because everything is impossible.
[26:58] You just have to understand that.
[27:05] If I am not focused, if I am not doing this, we don't earn the money.
[27:10] Exactly.
[27:11] If you look at this here as the most important thing, as a work,
[27:21] you have to invest your time and your eyes.
[27:25] And then you can...
[27:30] This is the reality, Claudia.
[27:36] I have a question.
[27:38] If I decide to go, for example, because we'll happen,
[27:44] it's a possibility that you receive the signal early.
[27:49] And we'll know.
[27:51] Exactly.
[27:52] If I go with my bicycle, I think that I should be driving around 30 minutes.
[28:02] If I want to come back, I can enter to the bus with my bicycle.
[28:08] Is it possible that?
[28:19] I'm going to investigate in work.
[28:21] I'm not sure.
[28:23] I think, but I'm not sure.
[28:27] Always we can find solutions.
[28:36] That's easy to say, Claudia.
[28:41] It's the same as maybe there will be 25 degrees in January.
[28:45] No, it will not Claudia.
[28:49] I understand.
[28:53] I understand perfectly.
[28:57] I can give you my opinion about...
[29:01] Of course we can always give opinion.
[29:03] No, I mean that I can be involved in trading things because it's not my knowledge.
[29:12] So I can't give my opinion about if this is...
[29:17] Because I don't know.
[29:19] But if I understand what I'm just blaming,
[29:23] and I'm going to give you my support
[29:28] with the things in the house if it's necessary, 60, 70, 80%.
[29:36] In the time.
[29:38] In the time of course.
[29:43] And...
[29:46] Do you have a little budget the next one, two weeks,
[29:54] to help with the food?
[30:00] Or is it impossible?
[30:04] I am using my credit card.
[30:10] And that means what?
[30:19] That I...
[30:22] I'm going to do my numbers too because I'm paying the English teacher.
[30:32] I bought the shoes and the jacket, the boys.
[30:40] With the credit card, I am paying that.
[30:44] And I...
[30:50] I think that I can use my credit card in the next week too.
[30:57] Yeah.
[30:58] As always.
[31:01] No, I ask you specific.
[31:04] What is possible and what is not possible?
[31:08] Because we...
[31:10] I don't want we go into next week or Friday and then we have cars.
[31:14] About this too.
[31:15] We have to make a control about a plan.
[31:19] About all.
[31:21] Yeah, but take a call with the car.
[31:25] I can drive.
[31:28] I talk about the economy.
[31:37] How much is that?
[31:41] I don't know.
[31:43] You know when you buy the food last time, you know how much it was.
[31:51] But we have rises, low price and we have potatoes.
[31:56] We have meat in the fridge.
[31:59] Of course we need to buy a little other things.
[32:02] Yeah, I can't do a low budget.
[32:05] Yeah.
[32:08] Okay, for the next two weeks.
[32:13] I think something like that.
[32:16] Because if I need to take out more money from the investments,
[32:25] I will not win as much money.
[32:34] Do you understand?
[32:36] Yes.
[32:38] If I only invest 1000 homeless instead of 10,000 homeless,
[32:45] there's a big difference in the winning.
[32:49] You understand?
[32:51] Yeah.
[32:55] Hmm?
[33:00] Hmm?
[33:03] Hmm?
[33:07] Are you able to do this a little moment, Claudia?
[33:12] Yeah.
[33:13] Or is it totally impossible?
[33:15] No.
[33:16] I can't.
[33:17] Because I am doing a risky tool, Claudia.
[33:21] Do you mean yes or do you say yes or mean no?
[33:28] No, I say that I can't in the next two weeks.
[33:32] Because if I use the money in the next two weeks,
[33:38] I is not David Carr.
[33:42] It's credit.
[33:44] So you don't have the money?
[33:46] I don't know what means David and created.
[33:49] Do you have money or do you not have money?
[33:52] No, I have it.
[33:54] You have money?
[33:55] No.
[33:56] Zero.
[33:57] I am using the money that I receive from the rent.
[34:04] And you know that I have to pay.
[34:06] Yes.
[34:07] And I have a little and the money that hangs for the children.
[34:12] So this money I can use.
[34:15] So you have a...
[34:21] You have a...
[34:23] On your account or minus.
[34:30] I don't understand.
[34:31] Do you have plus on your account or minus?
[34:35] No, I am a half the money that hangs sent me.
[34:40] I know.
[34:41] Yes.
[34:42] And I can pay with this using my credit card.
[34:46] Because I use the credit card and when she...
[34:49] The question is do you have money or do you don't...
[34:52] Or don't you have money?
[34:54] No.
[34:55] I have the money that I receive from the rent.
[34:58] Yeah.
[34:59] But I also have the money I received from my rent from my second house.
[35:03] Oh, huh.
[35:04] So the question is still the same.
[35:06] Do you have money?
[35:07] No matter where they are from.
[35:09] Yes or no?
[35:12] Yes.
[35:13] I have this money.
[35:15] But I need to use the money for pay.
[35:20] And I have a small yes for pay.
[35:24] How much do you have left over when you paid to the bank?
[35:33] Exactly.
[35:38] I mean that I have an accident around...
[35:48] That change of hands sent me is around an accident about...
[36:00] 500 dollars.
[36:02] And with this I can pay.
[36:07] Okay.
[36:08] That's okay Claudia.
[36:10] Okay.
[36:13] Then I think we have a plan.
[36:21] Because we was on this way.
[36:24] Now I think we have a plan Claudia.
[36:27] But we have to help each other to do this in this way.
[36:34] I will feel much more comfortable when I have the money in my account.
[36:47] I can put me into the training because then I can see that this is moving.
[36:53] And I will feel much more comfortable.
[37:12] I wish the best for you, for us.
[37:17] I wish I could be able to work.
[37:24] Because when you...
[37:26] No, the reality is not that you are not going to work soon.
[37:30] You know that too.
[37:32] The reality is that we have to try to find a economy now.
[37:39] But I am going to work.
[37:41] Yes.
[37:42] But that will not be soon Claudia.
[37:44] You know that too.
[37:48] Do you think that it is not possible?
[37:52] When you say so, I don't believe it Claudia.
[37:58] With the CPR, if I go to the job center...
[38:08] There will maybe be some possibilities for work Claudia.
[38:13] The next question is, do you want to have this work?
[38:17] What time do you have?
[38:19] You have a boy with disabilities.
[38:25] Maybe he can apply for some health.
[38:29] And this is going to help the economy.
[38:35] I don't know all the rules about this Claudia.
[38:38] I just know that I don't.
[38:41] You don't...
[38:45] You only have the time you have Claudia.
[38:48] You only also have the capacity you have.
[38:52] Mentally.
[38:55] We all only have 100% capacity.
[39:02] Mentally, energy, time.
[39:06] So dreaming about that I want to go to Hawaii today, be tomorrow.
[39:11] At work and the next day I want to fly to Miami.
[39:15] It's not possible.
[39:18] You will be very stressed if you have to go every morning with the childrens and work and buy food and take care of many things Claudia.
[39:45] Have you been thinking about this?
[39:51] Yes, but...
[39:54] Have you been thinking about that Claudia?
[39:57] Yes.
[40:00] Of course, yes.
[40:06] I am a strong person.
[40:11] Yes, I know that Claudia.
[40:16] But now...
[40:18] Or to see when people die.
[40:21] But now we need to be...
[40:23] Take too much energy out of the battery.
[40:25] But now...
[40:27] Don't you know what I mean?
[40:29] Yes.
[40:30] But now we need to be focused.
[40:32] Yes.
[40:33] Okay?
[40:34] So that's it for me.
[40:37] Don't worry.
[40:39] I only want to be quite calm with our stressful...
[40:48] Trying to be okay on the way.
[40:55] Stayed by a step.
[40:58] But this world is not easy.
[41:00] Yes.
[41:02] Now...
[41:11] I don't know me and you are not.
[41:13] We talk many times about that we are very, very unlucky.
[41:18] Do you know the word, what unlucky is?
[41:22] You can be lucky.
[41:25] You know what lucky is.
[41:27] You can also be the opposite.
[41:32] And actually me and you are not, we talk sometimes.
[41:35] We are afraid to wake up in the morning because...
[41:41] What is going to happen now?
[41:50] That's why it's very important that we have to do a change right now because...
[41:57] We don't know what is coming.
[42:04] Okay, I understand you.
[42:13] The good news is that we have things here for cook in the next days.
[42:18] That's only short time.
[42:20] I want to think long distance.
[42:25] Long time, Claudia, I look the law away.
[42:29] What is the solution?
[42:32] The solution is not continuing like we have to do.
[42:49] That was my words.
[42:55] And I have to realize I am living in another reality now.
[43:01] I have to find the budgets for my kids.
[43:05] I have to pay for them every month.
[43:09] And that is a big, big, expensive cost that I didn't have before.
[43:25] But with this idea, giving me the space,
[43:37] the feeling that is okay, I am sitting here because it's a part of the life.
[43:46] I will be more calm to say, okay, you accept?
[43:52] Because continuing in a situation with out of control and stress about what I do,
[44:06] that's not a life for me, Claudia.
[44:10] Then I will run away.
[44:13] One day I will take my auto cab and drive to...
[44:16] I don't know where I am running away.
[44:21] I can put a fire through this plate and I am away.
[44:24] I don't want to live that life.
[44:28] I am going to continue with my things.
[44:32] We can talk later about if you want to talk.
[44:37] But now, be quiet.
[44:41] Don't speak more about financial things.
[44:47] We can continue talking later.
[44:51] But we have an agreement now and you understand.
[44:56] I understand.
[45:07] I am too continue.
[45:12] Tomorrow you are going to do this.
[45:19] There is an election meeting tomorrow.
[45:27] I have to do a plan with that too to see.
[45:33] I can cook today.
[45:35] The only thing that I would like is how did you cook that?
[45:41] That's the only thing that I want to learn.
[45:44] I can do that in 10 minutes.
[45:47] It's not a problem.
[45:49] I come back in 15 minutes maybe for...
[45:53] I finish to do my things in the second floor and I can't help you cook the strawberries.

      That's good too, Claudia.

      And I have been looking on this here, Claudia.

    [23:36 - 23:40] Severidad: BAJA
      Maybe it's 80% now in a time, Claudia.

    [26:38 - 26:42] Severidad: BAJA
      It's also possible that I can drive for you, Claudia.

    [27:30 - 27:35] Severidad: BAJA
      This is the reality, Claudia.

    [28:36 - 28:41] Severidad: BAJA
      That's easy to say, Claudia.

    [28:45 - 28:49] Severidad: BAJA
      No, it will not Claudia.

    [33:07 - 33:12] Severidad: BAJA
      Are you able to do this a little moment, Claudia?

    [33:17 - 33:21] Severidad: BAJA
      Because I am doing a risky tool, Claudia.

    [36:08 - 36:10] Severidad: BAJA
      That's okay Claudia.

    [36:24 - 36:27] Severidad: BAJA

    [37:42 - 37:44] Severidad: BAJA
      But that will not be soon Claudia.

    [37:52 - 37:58] Severidad: BAJA
      When you say so, I don't believe it Claudia.

    [38:08 - 38:13] Severidad: BAJA
      There will maybe be some possibilities for work Claudia.

    [38:35 - 38:38] Severidad: BAJA
      I don't know all the rules about this Claudia.

    [38:45 - 38:48] Severidad: BAJA
      You only have the time you have Claudia.

    [39:18 - 39:45] Severidad: BAJA
      You will be very stressed if you have to go every morning with the childrens and work and buy food and take care of many things Claudia.

    [39:54 - 39:57] Severidad: BAJA
      Have you been thinking about that Claudia?

    [40:11 - 40:16] Severidad: BAJA
      Yes, I know that Claudia.

    [42:25 - 42:29] Severidad: BAJA
      Long time, Claudia, I look the law away.

    [44:06 - 44:10] Severidad: BAJA
      that's not a life for me, Claudia.
