B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] everything then you can get an under average average and over average so if you
[00:16] get a score that's an average then you have an average a functional level
[00:21] compared to children that's the same age when I look into your answers you answer
[00:30] that Juan Diego has a low total a low functional level in everyday life compared
[00:38] to his classmates and I think that's I understand why you have answered that in
[00:47] the questions and it tells me that he needs support there's nothing wrong with
[00:52] him he just needs support yeah the schools answers it puts him in this
[00:59] category that's very low yeah and to me I know it's not the same but they know
[01:09] that he needs help as well yeah this area or index so to speak you it was about
[01:20] the school the communication and controlling yourself you said he says he's
[01:25] under average so in this category and the school says very low so in school he
[01:36] needs a lot of support yeah so as well as home but it needs more support in school
[01:43] that's very normal then we have an area about the social ability and here you
[01:53] he's you place him in this category very low and so in school yeah sorry then we
[02:06] have the last topic that's about his practical and a being of ability so to speak it's
[02:17] about being out in traffic it's about taking care of yourself and so on and you
[02:23] place him in the very low category this question app doesn't fix anything for
[02:32] but it it describes him for yeah and the meaning about this paper is to make
[02:43] a judgment about if he has special needs or not and this question I can help me
[02:49] deciding that as well as your description and my observations in school
[02:56] Claudia you okay yeah do you need some tissue yeah I know it's hard to hear but I
[03:06] hope that we can help you and Juan Diego
[03:14] this paper making the judgment about and it's a little bit tricky but that if he
[03:21] needs help in over or under nine hours a week yeah and there's nothing it wasn't
[03:30] a hard decision for me it's very clear that he needs more than nine hours help or support
[03:36] a week and you need to that that's um he needs to have that to be in the school
[03:48] he is in now and I think it's very good that he's in that kind of school where
[03:52] they can help him and there's few students and a lot of teachers yeah and I
[03:59] wrote in this that he needs to be supported in his social cognitive behavior
[04:08] and that he needs a material that fits that fits his level you know in
[04:16] mathematics and in the English and Danish yeah it should fit him more than the
[04:25] average group yeah and I have also wrote that we need to support him in the social
[04:34] interaction with the other students because it looked like that he wants to
[04:42] interact with them but he needs help yeah he wants to have friends yeah I can see that
[04:48] is not easy because no no it is not but it looks like the other students in the classroom some
[05:04] of them reminds me of Juan Diego they have the same needs that he has and I think that's a good
[05:11] thing because maybe they understand each other and it's not it's good for him not to be the only
[05:18] one in the world with his needs yeah I have wrote that he needs visual support like the
[05:26] documents you send me because it's very clear that he needs visual support in not to draw he's
[05:33] very good at that but I think he uses less energy when he's visual supported than if we'd just
[05:41] talk with him yeah and then I wrote that he needs repetition if I explain something to him in
[05:54] in the in the English classes he needs a repetition to understand what we mean
[06:04] then I wrote that it's very important that the teachers are very clear and very you know
[06:10] concrete is it called that it's concrete in what they tell him they he doesn't need a lot of
[06:18] explanations it should be repeated but not different kinds of explanations specific specific exactly
[06:28] do you know that cloud yet specific yeah yeah and then I wrote that he needs a
[06:36] preparation to what he's gonna do tomorrow next week and he needs I'll try to say it and pronounce it
[06:45] predictability in Danish is predictively yeah just in the Spanish yeah exactly yeah I really think he needs that
[06:54] and right now he as I said he looks like he's glad of happy and it's a good school for him and I think
[07:02] it's important information when he's done being in this kind of school we kind of know what he needs
[07:10] in the future yeah and then I think this paper it can tell the people that's going to help him about
[07:18] that yeah so glad that this paper doesn't that doesn't fix anything for you over Juan de Ego but it
[07:26] is a description of what he needs for the people who can help yeah and yeah I have talked with Jacob
[07:36] about that when I have handed this for you I can send it to him per email and if he has any
[07:45] questions he can contact me yeah and then I would like to send it to the social workers well
[07:52] for example I am in those weeks near to my house or I think in different areas they are fixing
[08:04] that cross so doing some works and all the past transports you quit was affecting for example
[08:17] my boys normally take the bus for go to the school at 742 but now they are taking the bus 8 o'clock
[08:28] because I don't know what is happening but I'm worried because they are together they go
[08:38] together so José Carlos can support Juan de Ego but when they are come back at home
[08:50] we haven't any problem yet with Juan de Ego because he's taking the bus with the teachers but for
[08:58] example in the other case with my other boy José Carlos for example his and my mom I was waiting
[09:06] the bus at 224 and two days the bus never stopped okay the bus continued and I was there
[09:21] and you don't know because that bus don't enter and that next day when I was waiting outside the bus
[09:30] never stopped and he took another bus at 3 o'clock he finished 140 and the second bus
[09:40] lived him in other two kilometers from the home and I was thinking what will happen if this
[09:50] situation happened with Juan de Ego because I don't know José Carlos
[09:59] he can it sounds like he can solve the problem you know he can solve the bus problem but he can
[10:06] he knows what to do about calling you as soon but I'm not sure that Juan de Ego knows what to do
[10:14] when he meets the problem yeah yeah yeah I was with Juan de Ego some weeks ago in
[10:25] and footage yeah okay and I was looking something and I lost him for five seconds yeah
[10:35] because she continued walking yeah and he began to speak noise he said mama okay mama what are you
[10:46] but in this moment maybe the people that was around him what I am I in but I finally
[10:54] what can I do I and I saw him and I say I'm here yeah I am here the world
[11:05] yeah and when you're with him in physics it's I know it's outside but it's a safe place yes but we don't
[11:13] know what can happen other places or maybe he's alone exactly no I can I ask you a question
[11:20] when Claudia in physics was he looking on his phone yeah when he looks on his phone he don't know
[11:29] where he is in the phone yeah 100% okay he went to so there's maybe something to learn okay for me in
[11:40] they played football in the arena I don't know what to call in the school and there he didn't have
[11:47] his phone and to me it looked like he's in his own world even there without his phone but of
[11:54] course it's a thing that can be tricky he's more in his own world when he has his phone I think yes
[12:05] yeah but of course it's it's when he has his phone he can be
[12:13] going by a second yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he can be distracted by his phone but in the school he
[12:23] can be distracted the little folk of he has he used totally on the phone yeah then he don't know where he is
[12:29] but I also see in school that he is distracted without his phone you can see him in the school without
[12:36] the phone yeah I have they played football yeah okay yeah and there he was distracted by that there
[12:43] was other students by the side of the arena yeah so he was without his phone he don't use
[12:50] phone in the school he that it's your same with that because they have like we mean we think
[12:56] no no phone and when he take the bus he don't use the phone too because he I told him when they
[13:05] were nice I said him when they were pleased you can't use that because if you lost that stop
[13:10] bus you can go to another place and he's afraid for this yeah and he said I don't want to use my phone
[13:20] but okay but can't be happen and it's not yes I understand the phone but
[13:30] he have a problem yeah yeah he have a problem this is the reality and
[13:36] and I only want to find out this way yeah and when he's 18 years old my job isn't involved
[13:51] involved anymore because it's up till 18 years old and that's another reason why it's so important
[13:58] that the social worker is involved so they can help you and the educational guidance so you are
[14:05] not going to be when he's up 18 no no this is only from zero yes so to 18 years old because then
[14:13] you are an adult yeah yeah but as I said this paper doesn't fix anything but maybe it is a help
[14:23] by describing him yeah yeah yeah Claudia I would like to print this out to you and I would like
[14:33] to send it to Jacob and the social you Juan Diego Jacob the social worker and the educational
[14:44] I think that he needs a lot a lot of help with that language because yeah because when we haven't
[14:55] he have social and a problem with the communication social communication so is he having
[15:07] the language is a big problem because in my case for example I don't my English is
[15:20] intermediate so and I feel very bad when I can't express yeah all that I feel or all that I think
[15:32] and when the people makes me feel that they can't understand me or that I we can't communicate it
[15:42] that's me but I guess that what clapping with them with my boys yeah but Juan Diego can express him in
[15:53] English right yes yeah and maybe the Danish will come maybe not I know a lot of people in the spectrum
[16:02] and a lot of them likes to speak English a lot of them as English yeah not all of them of course
[16:08] but a lot of them likes to speak English but that doesn't mean he can't learn Danish but maybe he can
[16:15] learn Danish and I heard the the said a teacher by his side and they he he was reading Danish it was
[16:25] in another accent than than I'm using in Danish of course but it looked it looked like he
[16:31] yeah he did it with happiness reading Danish I'm not sure that he understood what he read but the
[16:42] teacher by his side translated some of the words from Danish to English so he knew what he was reading
[16:50] and that's a start in learning Danish yeah yeah yeah god yeah I will print this right now okay yeah
[17:02] and I wrote on the first page that he did Juan Diego doesn't have a CPI number yet no
[17:12] do you know when he will have that when he will get a CPI number in some months no maybe
[17:21] next year okay okay that's a long time but
[17:51] this system is not very fast
[18:22] so try to read it and though I'm only here for Juan Diego also he's 18 you can call me the next month
[18:34] it's so yeah of course you can and sometimes I talk with Jacob yeah I know Jacob so we can if
[18:44] if Juan Diego needs something I don't know what it should be because I think it's the right
[18:49] school but if you need something you can call me and then we can talk about it
[19:19] yeah
[19:27] you
