B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] Strong solution
[00:07] And it's not because it's in panic
[00:12] It's not because it's the only way
[00:21] With this
[00:30] That trading
[00:42] Of course if there is a little job in my company
[00:46] I have a little possibility now to go to fix something in a house
[00:55] But if we look on the budget what we need for money and what I can earn
[01:00] It will only and time will run and I will get old
[01:08] If we want to have a life we can't live here Claudia
[01:12] We have to go like this
[01:16] But you know that trading is not a job
[01:20] And you have the control with trading
[01:24] It's in reality you have the control
[01:28] Because if I follow this sequence Claudia
[01:32] We see in this results
[01:37] Continue coming here
[01:50] If you are sure to
[01:52] I am 100% sure
[01:56] The only thing is that
[02:00] When you think I can do the trading on my own
[02:06] And now please listen I want you to understand clearly
[02:12] That you know in this life you can be lucky and unlucky
[02:18] But you are not a professional
[02:22] What can we say?
[02:26] I count money there
[02:28] You are not that I am not too
[02:30] And I am not a professional trader too
[02:34] That doesn't mean that you can't count
[02:38] That doesn't mean that I can't trade
[02:42] And many times it will go good for me
[02:44] Maybe 8 out of 10 times it will go good
[02:48] But no but 9 and 10 it goes really bad
[02:52] Because I don't have
[02:56] All the knowledge about this
[03:00] So for that reason I should not do that
[03:06] That's just very hard for a man
[03:10] Like me who want to grow
[03:14] And always do my own business
[03:18] Do you understand?
[03:20] But what I say is that I learned
[03:22] I accept
[03:24] And I know
[03:26] This is not the way
[03:30] Because you
[03:32] I am not intelligent professional for
[03:36] This area to know
[03:38] Will it go up?
[03:40] Will it go down?
[03:42] Because that's the only two things
[03:44] Can happen
[03:46] Those people working with this
[03:48] They are very very very professional
[03:50] We've seen the results so many times
[03:54] I think it will go up now
[03:58] I can look in the market
[04:00] I feel and I think and I think
[04:02] But then it goes the wrong way
[04:04] I am not professional
[04:06] I know that
[04:08] So if I want to make money
[04:12] If I want to do it in a safe way
[04:14] Especially in this situation now
[04:18] I have to follow the trading signals
[04:22] Do the two trades today
[04:24] Stop
[04:26] Close the computer
[04:28] That's it
[04:36] Do you understand what I say?
[04:42] Yes, I understand
[04:46] What is your feeling now?
[04:50] So...
[05:00] I am honest with you, Clowny
[05:02] About what I think
[05:04] About what I see
[05:06] What I learn
[05:08] What I know
[05:10] I also know that I am not professional
[05:12] But many times when I look
[05:16] And I have my...
[05:18] I am sitting and thinking
[05:20] What will happen
[05:22] Okay, I also believe it goes down
[05:24] Many times I am right
[05:26] But also sometimes I am wrong
[05:28] They are more professional
[05:30] That's how it is
[05:32] And I should not take the risk
[05:38] I am going to study
[05:44] Do you want to...
[05:46] Go ahead
[05:48] I am going to study
[05:50] Do you want to study?
[05:52] Yes
[05:54] Go ahead
[05:56] Go ahead
[06:02] Yes
[06:04] Yes, but I am not sure
[06:06] I am going to study here
[06:08] But I am going to study here
[06:10] I am going to study here
[06:12] I am going to study here
[06:14] Yes
[06:20] I will not say
[06:22] I am not all-uward
[06:24] I am educated
[06:26] This is a good place
[06:34] But there are some things
[06:36] There are too many things
[06:42] We have a very small tank
[06:44] From here i canブ
[06:45] I learn 4 players
[06:46] That big tank is a tank
[06:48] That is what we have been paraillining
[06:50] It seems
[06:52] The
[07:01] row is
[07:17] What do you think of this line?
[07:23] First thought, I guess it was so far from Golden Emb焦 launch,
[07:26] So the track you see are separate but earlier on.
[07:28] Luckily I found it fast all these few years data,
[07:33] and some findings, hardware also.
[07:38] What has changed?
[07:40] What you have to fix is linking my software.
[07:43] ...
[07:51] they will teach us too much
[07:55] ah first you start
[08:01] czyli
[08:03] ok
[08:06] so
[08:07] we're all on a topic
[08:08] then I'll show you
[08:11] There's an oin, there mum, there.
[08:16] Yes yes its very good primarily but if you see how many phases
[08:40] even though it's程pil Hydrus, we sitting on Spam Bay where long advanced
[08:53] !!
[08:55] Also when you are in play where you are racing
[09:00] Your situations are to clear from both sides but stay stronger
[09:10] But the situation is that I have to pay myself a lot, because I don't have a job to do.
[09:19] And then I have to pay myself a lot, and in the end I have to pay for the job.
[09:22] And then I have to pay for the job.
[09:25] And then I have to pay myself a lot.
[09:29] And then I have to pay myself for the 3,000 today.
[09:36] Can we go now with this?
[09:39] Because I have also a pen that stands there, which can be said to be very good and to be balanced in things.
[09:55] No, but now I have a little kick-pull.
[10:02] Hey, hey.
[10:07] Hey.
[10:12] Hey.
[10:17] Hey, hey.
[10:22] Do you have an athlete with you around you?
