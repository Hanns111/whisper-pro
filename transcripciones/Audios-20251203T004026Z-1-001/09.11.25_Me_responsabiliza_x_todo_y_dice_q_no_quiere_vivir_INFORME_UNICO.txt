B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] You are an airy spare, an airy spare for people.
[00:05] But if you think that is not possible to share together,
[00:15] I am agree that you can go and we can stay here.
[00:22] You can spend your time with your friends and we can stay here at home.
[00:29] And I am okay with that decision.
[00:34] I am still not believe, you don't know who did it.
[00:44] I believe in you.
[00:49] You don't believe, you don't know who did it.
[00:55] I believe in you.
[01:02] You believe in me.
[01:05] And when I say it's him, you say no, it's not.
[01:09] I only say you that I ask him, and he say no.
[01:13] And that is the reality, what he say.
[01:16] Because he is airy normal.
[01:20] When you say that he is very normal, you are saying that with another world.
[01:27] Because you know that he is in a spectrum of this.
[01:33] You don't have to explain me things, I already know one million times, Claudia.
[01:38] I get question in my head.
[01:41] Sometimes your worlds are idonic.
[01:45] Yes, they are because this is question.
[01:48] This was not here before, we are four people.
[01:54] And you think I am a complete idiot.
[01:57] And there is no other people visiting us.
[02:01] So it's very simple.
[02:06] You have a son who lives for you now.
[02:09] But you don't accept that.
[02:12] Because if you are little boy, he can do whatever he wants.
[02:16] If he wants to piss in the corner, he can do it.
[02:19] I am accepting your words.
[02:21] You are protecting him, no matter what he does.
[02:24] I am accepting your words.
[02:27] I don't want problems, please.
[02:30] No.
[02:32] I am accepting your words.
[02:34] It's because you don't see this here as a problem.
[02:37] What do you think if he was...
[02:40] Let's take another situation.
[02:42] Let's say we go to some of my friends and he did the same in their houses.
[02:47] What do you think will happen then?
[02:51] Do you have an insurance to pay for that?
[02:57] Do you think the family will visit they accept that?
[03:04] So who has a problem?
[03:08] You have a problem.
[03:14] You are all a protected feminist situation, which your children is destroying them.
[03:20] But you don't recognize.
[03:22] And now you believe in him.
[03:25] What do you...
[03:27] I want you to see the reality, but it's not going to happen.
[03:31] What do you expect about me?
[03:35] What do you want that I do?
[03:37] Tell me, please, because I want to give a solution now.
[03:40] I don't think there is no solution because you are mentally developed in many, many years.
[03:53] It's a kind of...
[03:56] That will not change because I say a few words.
[03:59] You are your own person, you do whatever you want.
[04:02] You are the big lawyer from Peru.
[04:05] You can do whatever you want.
[04:08] We are here, we are in them.
[04:11] I am doing my best.
[04:14] You also told me those words.
[04:16] So I know where they come from.
[04:18] They come deep in straight from your herd.
[04:20] My actions.
[04:21] You know what I am doing at home.
[04:24] I am trying to do the best for us.
[04:26] I am cooking all day.
[04:28] But you also have two children.
[04:31] It's not my children.
[04:33] But we are a family.
[04:35] You don't need to do anything for me.
[04:37] Zero.
[04:39] I can do my own little bread for me.
[04:42] It takes me very few minutes before you arrived.
[04:46] My life was very, very uncomplicated.
[04:50] Very quiet.
[04:52] Without any problem.
[04:55] Nothing.
[04:59] Yes.
[05:01] I want to, I love you.
[05:05] We have a project of life.
[05:12] Yeah, who will never be finished because this is will never going to change.
[05:17] They are going to do their own life.
[05:21] No.
[05:22] Yes, because they are growing and there are many places where they can go and they do their own life.
[05:36] I know you Claudia.
[05:38] That is not going to be reality.
[05:41] Yes.
[05:42] Because I love, I want a life with you.
[05:49] This is not a life for me Claudia.
[05:52] I am so stressed.
[05:59] Yes.
[06:02] I am so stressed.
[06:07] Yes.
[06:09] I am so stressed.
[06:12] Yes.
[06:13] I am so stressed.
[06:16] Yes.
[06:17] And I think every day I don't want to live anymore.
[06:24] I don't want to live anymore.
[06:28] Please, take it.
[06:30] Two worlds make me feel very sad.
[06:32] Yeah, me too.
[06:34] Because I always can fight and go over the surface.
[06:39] But no, I can't.
[06:42] I think every day I don't want more.
[06:46] There is no use for me.
[06:53] Okay.
[06:54] And I know that you are worried for the money because you want money for continuing investing in that crypto.
[07:07] I know that you lost the money there, but it is not our fault.
[07:14] I know that you don't have to explain me that.
[07:18] I am very responsible about also when I did something wrong.
[07:23] But those things make you feel sad.
[07:27] All.
[07:30] It's a combination.
[07:32] But when I see my property here, I have no money.
[07:36] I try to save.
[07:39] All the money I can.
[07:41] And I see a person destroying my house without accepting or he doesn't care.
[07:47] Simply don't care.
[07:49] Yes.
[07:50] It's fucking don't care.
[07:52] Okay.
[07:54] I promise you that it's not going to happen again.
[07:58] I promise you.
[07:59] This is it.
[08:00] There is more destroyed in this house.
[08:02] You know that too.
[08:04] It's not going to happen.
[08:06] I am going to do my business.
[08:10] Okay.
[08:11] Please.
[08:12] I don't want to fight too much.
[08:14] I want a quiet life with two of you.
[08:17] Yes.

[08:21] But who is going to pay?
[08:23] I'm going to pay.
[08:25] Who is going to pay for the telephone?
[08:27] Who is going to pay for the internet?
[08:29] We don't have the money, Claudia.
[08:31] Yeah.
[08:33] And you want to go to a party to 2000 homeless?
[08:37] I don't have that money.
[08:39] I don't want to go to any party.
[08:41] You told me yesterday.
[08:43] I asked you about that party from the last year.
[08:47] But I never said.
[08:48] You're not for free.
