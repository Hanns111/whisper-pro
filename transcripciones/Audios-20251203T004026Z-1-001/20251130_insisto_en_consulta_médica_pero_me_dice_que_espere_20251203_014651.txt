 Maybe you can give me the phone and make a call to ask to the doctor if I can go for a situation because I would like to want to know something because I would like to get a control with a Doppler. Do you know what's Doppler? A Doppler. A Doppler is a machine that they put here and that Doppler can't know how is your heart for one day on in some case today and then you can see always your population that count. You don't think you'll give it a little time Claudia? To my heart, to wait for the doctor. I'm going to continue control. I'm going to continue controlling. I am only controlling with my oxymetra. I'm going to continue control. I'm going to continue control. I'm going to continue control. I'm going to continue control. I'm going to continue control. I'm going to continue control. I'm going to continue control.
