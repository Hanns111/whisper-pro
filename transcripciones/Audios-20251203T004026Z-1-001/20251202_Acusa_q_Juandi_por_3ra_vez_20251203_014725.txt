Okay? Before you arrived to this house, this wall was complete. Now we see, not only one time, not only two times. Now three times, with evidence. When I went to the bathroom, I checked the wall. It was normal, and I was one of less. And now it's broken somehow. I don't know how. When we arrived from the trip to there, he was in the toilet. So... No? No? Yes. No? No, he was. But after the last. But he didn't, because I was there, and it didn't. And I make sure it was normal. And now it's broken. Yes. So, who do you think it is? Not me. Not me, Jandiego. And not you. No, we didn't. Do you think I do it? I'm not saying that guy. Do you think I destroyed my own house? I'm saying we did it. We didn't. Who has been in this house? We don't know. And you... You make me... Like a fool. What's happening in fool? Fool. Don't talk. No, anybody say that. And what do we do then? And we finish this because we didn't. And we did that. So, next time it's happening, when all the wall is taken down, who did it? I'm going to take a video about this. Because I am very anxious waiting here, but you are accusing me. He is having a... You are accusing me here. And you... Can I destroy something of your thinks? I don't understand. No. No. Because you are saying that he is... He has a disability. He is not about disability. No, but this is about what is removing from the wall. Yeah, but he didn't. He is saying that he didn't. Okay. And now... Maybe you are doing this because you want to accuse us to leave the house. Yeah, but... No. I think... I am thinking. Yeah, you think a lot of things. Come on, little guys. That is not true. You don't know how I did it. You know that. I don't know now. Exactly. Come on.
