[03:52] ...dear it ...
[03:59] ...dear it ...
[04:21] 24 jaar,
[04:30] Some of your friends, we were at the party
[04:33] and you have to talk with Helma
[04:35] because he is also training.
[04:39] That does not mean that if other do that with two,
[04:44] I mean that with all the money that
[04:48] just are the loose,
[04:52] many people can live more than one year
[04:59] and this money can invest in another kind of job
[05:04] more safe or maybe in actions
[05:08] do you remember that you had action in this?
[05:12] No, I don't.
[05:15] We didn't lost $70,000.
[05:20] We were earning $70,000.
[05:25] But in the months...
[05:30] That's correct Claudia.
[05:33] That's correct.
[05:35] But you can't win money without doing any kind of investment.
[05:41] But I have a question in my life
[05:44] and I am not blame you, I am not just nothing.
[05:49] I only tell me in all these months
[05:54] you lose and don't win.
[05:58] So if we analyze not fighting
[06:04] as a couple with the hurt...
[06:07] You want that I go into my red truck and start my company?
[06:12] No, I...
[06:14] You have a dream that I only possible and...
[06:19] Lars, I don't want that you have something.
[06:23] Just because they won't do those
[06:26] I really was afraid for your health when I saw you.
[06:31] We...
[06:32] One thing, Claudia, we don't need to discuss things
[06:35] we already know.
[06:37] Please.
[06:38] You told me this...
[06:41] 20 times.
[06:43] Please don't repeat things that I know, Claudia.
[06:47] It doesn't bring us any places to talk the same words.
[06:52] Over and over and over again.
[06:55] I know my success, Black.
[06:58] You don't have to tell me that, Claudia.
[07:00] Please.
[07:02] Give me some value information.
[07:08] Don't express things I know already, Claudia.
[07:14] Please.
[07:21] Claudia, you have a nose there.
[07:24] You know you have a nose.
[07:26] Please, Claudia.
[07:32] This life is not easy, Claudia.
[07:39] This knee always over.
[07:44] This knee always over.
[07:49] This knee always over.
[07:54] This knee always over.
[07:59] I feel worried.
[08:06] Me too, Claudia. Me too.
[08:14] And you believe if I go into the red truck,
[08:18] all will be solved and you put a marketing and then all will be good.
[08:22] And the money will be...
[08:26] The house will be full of money.
[08:29] I can tell you one thing.
[08:32] What will happen?
[08:33] We will get more poor.
[08:35] That's the only thing we will have in the world.
[08:56] It's the big company who run this, Claudia.
[09:11] We can't be in the market.
[09:17] That's the way things are changing.
[09:23] You can't do nothing about it, Claudia.
[09:26] The sun goes down.
[09:29] You can't change it, Claudia.
[09:53] You saw how many money I had.
[10:02] You saw that I started and it was growing.
[10:06] I was growing good, Claudia.
[10:11] The problem was...
[10:15] I know what.
[10:16] There were two problems.
[10:19] I believed that I should do trade number two.
[10:26] Normally they go down and it was going very much down.
[10:32] Normally it goes up again.
[10:36] But this time it was continuing going down.
[10:40] That's my fault.
[10:42] That's fault number one.
[10:45] The fault number two was we put it.
[10:48] I should have taken one third of the money into the electronic pocket.
[10:55] Because with so much money earned.
[11:02] It's not a problem to take money out.
[11:06] And then all has been saved.
[11:16] That was nice.
[11:27] Yes.
[11:33] It's not like you should send me a lot of pictures or stuff and stuff.
[11:42] I think I can ask for a lot of money or what I should do or not.
[11:49] I could find a number and I could find a lot of money.
[11:52] I think it's a good idea that I can ask for a lot of money.
[11:59] That's a good idea.
[12:06] That's a good idea.
[12:12] Okay.
[12:19] Yeah.
[12:26] Yeah.
[12:31] And we'll have a little bit of it.
[12:39] Two flashbigas.
[12:43] How do we have flashbigas that's right over there?
[12:48] That's right.
[12:55] Yeah.
[13:00] I think it's a good idea to put it in the pocket.
[13:07] So, I'll put it in the pocket.
[13:14] Yeah.
[13:18] These are the things that I have to put in here.
[13:21] I have to put it in here and I want to put it in the pocket.
[13:28] No.
[13:35] Yeah, but I think I can find it.
[13:41] No.
[13:48] No.
[13:55] There are a lot of things that I should do in the future.
[14:00] The education of the organisation.
[14:04] There are some things that I can do in the future.
[14:09] I think it's a good idea.
[14:16] There are a lot of things that I can do in the future.
[14:23] So, these are traditional gas bottles that you just use in the household.
[14:28] You just have to put them in the gas bottle.
[14:30] Then you can use this 30 millibar.
[14:35] If that's what I have to do, if that's not what I have to do, then it's a high-tracks bottle.
[14:40] I'll put it in the bag and then you can install it.
[14:43] It's more complicated.
[14:46] It's more complicated than a gun.
[14:52] Yeah.
[14:59] No, but that's what I have to say.
[15:01] It's because I have to put it in the bag and put it in the bag.
[15:04] I have to find it now.
[15:08] I don't have any other choice.
[15:11] It's because of the equipment.
[15:24] It's typical, I write down what the instructions for the bag should be.
[15:32] I want to make it a bit easier to use.
[15:35] I can do it because I just have to put it in the bag.
[15:40] Yeah.
[15:44] Yeah.
[15:50] I just have to put it in the bag.
[15:54] We can do it.
[15:57] So.
[16:11] It's not a joke, but I'll put it in the bag.
[16:15] I'll put it in the bag and then you can put it in the bag.
[16:20] I'll put it in the bag and then you can put it in the bag.
[16:24] Yeah.
[16:29] Yeah, that's understandable.
[16:33] Yeah.
[16:39] Yeah.
[16:44] Yeah.
[16:51] Yeah, that's understandable.
[16:58] No.
[17:03] No, no, no, no.
[17:05] We're going to put it in the bag.
[17:07] We're going to put it in the bag.
[17:17] Yeah.
[17:19] Yeah.
[17:22] Yeah.
[17:24] Yeah, we're going to put it in the bag.
[17:35] I think it's a bit easier to use.
[17:39] Yeah.
[17:41] But it's not a joke.
[17:44] Yeah.
[17:47] The next step is to put it in the bag.
[17:50] And then you have to put it in the bag.
[17:54] Yeah.
[17:59] Yeah.
[18:04] Yeah.
[18:09] Yeah.
[18:15] Yeah.
[18:18] Yeah, but it's not a joke.
[18:22] Yeah.
[18:26] Yeah, I don't know.
[18:28] But we have to put it in the bag.
[18:31] If you have a gun, you can put it in the bag.
[18:36] And then you put it in the bag.
[18:40] It's not a joke.
[18:43] We can put it in the bag.
[18:46] We're going to put it in the bag.
[18:49] So if you put it in the bag, you can put it in the bag.
[18:52] So you have to put it in the bag.
[18:55] Because it's a bag that can be used in the bag.
[18:58] It's not a bag that can be used in the bag.
[19:03] Yeah, but when you put it in the bag, it's a bit dirty.
[19:07] But the things that make this situation worse
[19:11] are the two guns that can be used together.
[19:14] So you can say if you put it in the bag, for example, a bag that I've put in,
[19:19] you can put it in the bag.
[19:21] But then it's a little bit dirty.
[19:25] So that's what it is.
[19:28] So you can say,
[19:33] if you can put it in the bag, you can put it in the bag.
[19:38] But if you put it in the bag, you can put it in the bag.
[19:41] I'll give you a little bit of a bag that I've put in the bag.
[19:45] And then you put it in the bag.
[20:03] Yeah.
[20:25] I have seen that.
[20:27] I have seen that.
[20:29] But I think you can express something before you know it.
[20:35] You know, there is no sound from the organization.
[20:39] And when you put it in the bag, you look at it and give it away.
[20:44] Then you say, okay, in this situation,
[20:46] yes, that's what it was like, I was like,
[20:49] if you can feel it, it's not good for you.
[20:51] Instead of going, yes, it's like that.

[21:18] Og når du har en pær, men så er det heller ikke,
[21:21] så er det heller ikke, hvad du har en sige, de store problemer.
[21:24] Det bliver selvfølgelig lidt byrre,
[21:27] fordi der skal jo noget andet, elektriskudstyrer,
