B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] L央.
[00:09] I'm going to make that double-finger, okay?
[00:26] I'm so sorry.
[00:35] And then I have to accept to live with a family who lies.
[00:40] What will be the next time?
[00:42] He will lie at the same time.
[00:44] Now last week, I don't attend this unit, but...
[00:49] And you believe?
[00:50] Last.
[00:51] Give me an explanation.
[00:52] Who did it then?
[00:53] Listen, I don't know.
[00:57] But I am going to pay for the fixed part, okay?
[01:03] Please.
[01:04] Because it's a form to be careful with your house.
[01:09] And to let me know how much I have to pay, and I'm going to do that, please.
[01:20] I don't want to fight.
[01:23] You don't understand.
[01:24] I understand what are you feeling, how do you feel?
[01:29] And I open to pay this, please.
[01:35] Please accept that.
[01:37] You think it's just putting money into the air.
[01:41] You can't buy this material.
[01:57] This here is about something completely different, Claudia.
[02:05] If one person can do that, what is this person going to do?
[02:14] Next and next and next and next.
[02:20] Yeah, I understand.
[02:24] You point, I'm going to talk again with the voice.
[02:28] Okay?
[02:29] I know that he is lying.
[02:31] You talking about one there?
[02:33] Yes.
[02:34] Well, Lars, I feel that it's not only because you think that you were talking a few minutes
[02:45] ago that you don't lie, how he eats.
[02:49] Of course not.
[02:51] That's not normal.
[02:54] He is trying to do his best, but sometimes I feel that you don't feel comfortable near
[03:02] to him.
[03:08] This is, I feel that how you...
[03:12] I am not used to living in a house with screaming and shouting and spittacle every day.
[03:23] When I want to sleep on the sofa, I can't because there is someone sitting here.
[03:31] No.
[03:32] No?
[03:33] Yes, he speaks alone and I go and I say, please try to not
[03:41] down to your voice.
[03:44] But he has a condition.
[03:47] I know that.
[03:51] And maybe this is not my life, Claudia.
[03:54] But Lars.
[03:57] Why should I be put on this life, to put in this misery?
[04:03] Why?
[04:10] Because now we are a family and when you know me and we fully love.
[04:20] You promised me many things.
[04:22] We have a project of life and now.
[04:27] You are all protecting your children.
[04:29] You are not learning them anything.
[04:30] You are not developing them.
[04:32] And I know the feminist excites of all this bullshit and I don't care about it.
[04:38] You are completely exactly the same as all the other.
[04:42] You protect your children and you want to fight with the man because you...
[04:47] I know exactly how it is.
[04:50] Lars, they are glowing.
[04:52] They are...
[04:53] They are...
[04:54] They are...
[04:55] They are...
[04:56] They are like five years old.
[05:00] They...
[05:01] I...
[05:02] We are...
[05:03] You are twenty years behind.
[05:07] We are...
[05:08] We are knowing the system.
[05:10] They are going to enter on the system soon.
[05:14] They are now in the system studying.
[05:17] Next year, he has to do another activity this more time.
[05:21] And Jose Carlos too.
[05:24] Please Lars.
[05:27] Please be a little patient.
[05:29] And to him my best, we are a family.
[05:36] Please.
[05:39] This is one big nightmare, Claudia.
[05:48] That's the only thing it is.
[05:59] I can't even go to my own toilet.
[06:01] I don't know what I am going to sit on.
[06:03] There is peace on the floor.
[06:05] It's disgusting.
[06:06] It's not peace on the floor when he calls...
[06:09] Yeah, you have to clean every three seconds.
[06:13] No, he...
[06:14] What he's having and the water goes down to the floor, but it's not peace.
[06:23] But what is the water around the toilet?
[06:27] No, because he was...
[06:30] In the toilet? No, no, no.
[06:34] He...
[06:37] He was with a piece of paper.
[06:41] And he cleaned his hands.
[06:45] And sometimes he cleaned again.
[06:48] With paper?
[06:50] No, exactly.
[06:51] I am not going to pay for 500 toilets rolls in the month, Claudia.
[06:56] No, no, no.
[07:00] You can pay for the toilet.
[07:03] You can pay for the toothpaste.
[07:05] You can use as much as you want.
[07:07] This is not normal.
[07:10] And you think I would...
[07:12] My bag is already totally destroyed.
[07:14] And I have to work to earn a little money.
[07:17] And then you spend a lot of money off wasting.
[07:20] No, I am paying that.
[07:23] With my... Yes, I am paying.
[07:27] But what about learning the reality to the people instead?
[07:31] Yes.
[07:32] That is not going to happen.
[07:34] It's a little...
[07:36] A little what?
[07:37] Hard to learn...
[07:39] No.
[07:40] A person to teach when you have a disability.
[07:44] Please, this is only that.
[07:47] I know to make a...
