[03:58] I understand what I'm using.
[04:00] Yeah.
[04:01] Okay.
[04:02] So please, we have to be carefully with all the things in the house.
[04:09] Because we need to respect the house.
[04:15] Okay.
[04:16] And I am not saying that you was or you was.
[04:20] Because I don't know.

[05:05] It's okay if I do it in your house.
[05:08] No, it's not okay.
[05:09] But do you are asking me what I think if I do that?
[05:14] No, I didn't say that.
[05:16] Ah, okay.
[05:17] I didn't say that.
[05:18] Okay.
[05:19] Because I'm...
[05:21] I didn't know...
[05:24] It's not...
[05:25] I don't know what happened.
[05:27] But what can I say?
[05:29] I know what's happening.
[05:30] Someone removed this piece of the wallpaper.
[05:34] Someone did it.
[05:38] And there has only been us four people in this house.
[05:42] Why you say him?
[05:44] You want to...
[05:45] I say there has only been us four in this house.
[05:49] Yeah.
[05:50] Okay.
[05:51] That's not hard to understand it.
[05:53] No, because I don't know.
[05:56] You don't know?
[05:58] Have you have other people here?
[06:02] No, I say that I don't know.
[06:05] Is someone removed, as you say?
[06:08] Maybe this fall down alone?
[06:11] What?
[06:12] I don't know.
[06:13] Because there's...
[06:14] You already searched there and there's nothing.
[06:17] We all can search the piece, I don't know.
[06:20] But we can't find it.
[06:22] So there's maybe another...
[06:23] So it could not...
[06:25] Maybe go then.
[06:26] No?
[06:27] No?
[06:28] No.
[06:29] No.
[06:31] Because if not even this can go through...
[06:34] How?
[06:35] Ah.
[06:36] This.
[06:38] Is it good?
[06:39] Now I have an authorization as Plumber in 40 years.
[06:44] So I know what is possible and not possible with water and toilets.
[06:48] Whoa.
[06:49] Mm-hmm.
[06:50] There.
[06:51] Okay.
[06:53] But...
[06:56] What we're trying to say is that we understand that we...
[06:59] But we are saying that we didn't do it and we wouldn't like to make you angry.
[07:05] Because we also don't want to make this.
[07:09] No one wants to make that.
[07:11] And we're trying to find a solution.
[07:14] But we all already said that we didn't do it.
[07:17] And we're not trying to learn something.
[07:20] We all already said that.
[07:22] But you can only speak for yourself.
[07:25] No, I'm not talking about it.
[07:27] You can only speak for yourself.
[07:30] I...
[07:31] You can not speak for other people.
[07:34] Not only me speaking.
[07:36] Go ahead and speak for me.
[07:39] What?
[07:40] Okay.
[07:58] It's made me really, really, really sad.
[08:07] Yeah.
[08:09] I really, really sad too.
[08:12] Yeah.

[08:14] Because.
[08:15] Yeah. Why?
[08:16] Because I didn't.
[08:18] He said that you are sad.
[08:20] You are not sad that my house is destroyed.
[08:23] That's the difference.
[08:26] No one cares.
[08:29] No one says, oh, I care.
[08:32] It's not about this, it's about that we are now a family.
[08:38] Yes.
