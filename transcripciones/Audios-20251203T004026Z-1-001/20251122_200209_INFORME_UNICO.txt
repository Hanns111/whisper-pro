[01:07] because you haven't the money for pay this.
[01:11] And I can do something, I can talk.
[01:14] At home with my friends that they said me the money for pay that.
[01:21] Please.
[01:23] I come from one big cash.
[01:31] Yeah, but...
[01:33] You don't listen to how my life has been.
[01:38] More than...
[01:41] More than 15 years.
[01:44] With one big cash.
[01:48] But it's more than 15 years.
[01:50] But with the other.
[01:51] And now I continue with the next.
[01:53] But this is not my responsibility.
[01:55] No, but it's just to express that I am not an animal too.
[02:01] I am an human too.
[02:06] I am a human too.
[02:11] I lost.
[02:14] I lost.
[02:16] So many things you don't believe.
[02:19] I didn't see my boys.
[02:22] I lost my genitals.
[02:24] I lost and lost.
[02:26] I fight and fight for the freedom and people.
[02:29] And who is the only one destroying the money, the soul, the brain, me?
[02:35] Yeah, Lars, but listen to me please.
[02:38] This about a family of re-efficient.
[02:41] It's very important for me and the boys, you know.
[02:44] And it's due to...
[02:46] You say that you received this email a long time ago?
[02:49] I didn't open it.
[02:51] I didn't see it before now.
[02:54] Okay, so we can resolve this.
[02:57] Please.
[03:03] I can pay for that.
[03:09] Okay.
[03:11] I can pay for that.
[03:13] I want to begin to work.
[03:16] And...
[03:19] And if...
[03:22] When we get that...
[03:25] The residents, maybe you don't want to be more about me, but I don't know what I did.
[03:35] That nothing broke.
[03:37] No, you did not.
[03:39] Nothing wrong, Claudia.
[03:41] We are just two different.
[03:45] We are two different, Claudia.
[03:52] I don't want to criticize.
[03:55] But I can't accept destroying my house and you have a boy I know who do it.
[04:03] And you say he don't lie.
[04:05] Now I have evidence this is happening in the South.
[04:12] We are two different, Claudia.
[04:23] Can we try to have a good time in the next month, please?
[04:30] I don't want to find out.
[04:34] I don't want to be a good person.
[04:39] I don't want to fight, but I have to be honest too, Claudia.
[04:47] I am very, very pressed because I was coming from one house.
[04:56] I survived.
[04:58] I built this house up for me and my boys.
[05:02] I lost my boys.
[05:04] I struggled with my company in a long time.
[05:08] I struggled with my economy, but I did all this alone.
[05:16] And for the first time in many years I could sit down in my tier without having nice, without having problems.
[05:28] I feel safe.
[05:30] I could relax inside.
[05:35] And now I did something stupid things.
[05:39] And now I have economic problems.
[05:42] I don't know how to do.
[05:44] I am tired.
[05:46] I am tired.
[05:48] I am tired into my bones.
[05:51] I am tired of politics.
[05:53] I am tired of explaining.
[05:57] I am tired of discussing who did the walls or not did the walls in the toilet.
[06:03] I have to explain everything thousands times how to cook a potato is put into water and heat it up.
[06:12] Holy Christ.
[06:17] I have the responsibility of everything here.
[06:20] I don't have the economy.
[06:22] I have no work.
[06:23] I lost my job.
[06:24] I lost my economy.
[06:25] I can't run the company.
[06:26] I lost the money and the trading.
[06:28] I lost my temperance.
[06:31] What possibilities do I have?
[06:35] I am destroyed in my head.
[06:38] A physical I am destroyed.
[06:41] Now I am nervous inside like a dead man.
[06:45] You look me in the eyes and I am already dead.
[06:48] The spirit has left my body.
[06:51] There is nothing left.
[06:53] I fight it all the way.
[06:56] I am an empty cello.
[07:04] And then I have to discuss with you who did the walls in the kitchen in the toilet.
[07:08] I don't want to do this.
[07:11] No, but I don't want that people they destroy my house is disrespectful.
[07:16] Lars, do you know?
[07:21] There is no explanation for that.
[07:23] No, no, no.
[07:25] I know.
[07:26] He is lying and you accept it.
[07:29] Lars, okay.
[07:31] He is not about okay.
[07:32] You say one thing you mean a lot.
[07:35] My son has a disability.
[07:38] He is an autistic expert.
[07:40] Yes, I know.
[07:41] You have told me that seven thousand times.
[07:44] I want to do all the things okay.
[07:47] I always try to do that.
[07:51] I am angry with me and the boys.
[07:54] I try to be honest with them.
[07:57] But now?
[07:59] I was trying to sleep in the sofa and in the second floor he was...
[08:07] He was looking at me.
[08:09] I am more with him.
[08:11] What I say is not true.
[08:13] No, it's not true what I say.
[08:15] Again I lie.
[08:16] No, I don't say that.
[08:17] I am a liar again.
[08:19] What I say is not true.
[08:20] No, please.
[08:22] I don't say nothing.
[08:24] What I say is not true.
[08:26] This is not my reality.
[08:28] The war was here before.
[08:30] The picture was something I did in many forlaces in the computer.
[08:37] No, forgive me.
[08:38] I said nothing wrong.
[08:47] I really want to do all the things okay for us.
[08:51] Yes, I know Claudia.
[08:53] I know.
[08:54] But the truth that maybe you don't love me anymore.
[08:58] We are two different Claudia.
[09:02] But Lars, did you know all of this about this where we know us?
[09:08] Maybe I was dreaming.
[09:14] But the reality is another Claudia.
[09:24] You can blame me all you want.
[09:29] It was maybe my fault.
[09:32] Because I shouldn't have...
[09:38] I was maybe...
[09:41] I don't know.
[09:42] I was maybe dreaming that everything will be wonderful for me and for you and the boys and everything will be happy family.
[09:54] I was having an illusion.
[10:00] Maybe I listened too much to your words and I believe that...
[10:06] And maybe it's me inside, destroyed.
[10:10] Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[10:14] And I don't want to talk about all things happening.
[10:18] But what was happening in the start with your alcohol?
[10:22] Holy Christ.
[10:23] Lars, I don't drink nothing.
[10:26] No.
[10:27] No.
[10:28] I know.
[10:29] And I have a problem with alcohol.
[10:31] No.
[10:32] And we need to talk about all the things that you are telling now.
[10:38] Because it's important for me and my boys now.
[10:44] Because we are humans.
[10:47] And we are thinking in our future too.
[10:51] Yes.
[10:52] Because the Carlos isn't schooled.
[10:55] Yes.
[10:56] And if you don't want nothing with us,
[11:00] okay?
[11:02] Because I think that you are doing all this...
[11:07] speaking for tell me something.
[11:11] Okay?
[11:12] But if you don't want nothing with us, please.
[11:15] We now are in the process and we want...
[11:20] be the opportunity to be here.
[11:24] But I am doing all my best because I have feelings for you.
[11:31] But I think that you don't want to my boys.
[11:35] So, okay.
[11:36] We are trying to go when I get a job.
[11:41] I can rent some space for them.
[11:48] Okay?
[11:54] Okay.
[12:04] This is it to say now I love you.
[12:09] And tomorrow I don't love you.
[12:11] I'm not sure.
[12:12] Maybe I get a mistake.
[12:14] No, it's not fair.
[12:16] It's not fair for me.
[12:17] It's not fair for my children because we left all.
[12:21] I lost my job because I don't want to work anymore because I'm going to get married with my love of my life.
[12:31] I live my insurance of life after 17 years.
[12:39] I know.
[12:40] I live all.
[12:41] And now?
[12:42] And now?
[12:43] I am here waiting because I am not alone.
[12:50] I am not a lazy person.
[12:52] I want to work.
[12:53] I want to work.
[12:54] No, I want to say that.
[12:55] No, but you make me feel that I am a charge.
[12:58] That I am a big baggash for you now.
[13:01] That you feel stressed because you don't worry.
[13:05] You have it.
[13:06] And you make me feel that it's my fault.
[13:09] Sorry for that.
[13:10] You make me feel...
[13:11] Sorry for that.
[13:12] That's not the point for me.
[13:14] Sorry.
[13:15] But you make me feel...
[13:16] Yes, but I say sorry.
[13:20] And now I say, OK.
[13:22] Maybe.
[13:27] You are not sure about your feelings because I am a responsible person with my feelings.
[13:36] I have not seen for me say today I love you and tomorrow say, oh, sorry.
[13:42] I make a mistake because I don't sure inside me.
[13:48] No, this is not a person mature.
[13:52] OK.
[13:53] I am not a moral girl.
[13:55] I mean, not an adolescent.
[13:57] I am a woman.
[13:58] I can say that.
[13:59] No, but I am talking with you now as a couple.
[14:03] I am talking with you now that you can't do that with me because you are destroying my feelings.
[14:11] Or I am respect you.
[14:14] I respect you.
[14:16] I don't speak with nothing because I love you.
[14:20] I don't need to talk with another person.
[14:24] I respect to my husband.
[14:26] I respect my family.
[14:28] I am doing all that the things that I have with love.
[14:33] I cook for you.
[14:34] And I, not because it's my responsibility because I want to make you happy.
[14:39] I always think what would you like to eat?
[14:43] I know plenty.
[14:45] And you do that very well.
[14:48] I have nothing to claim about you.
[14:50] I bring all the days for us because I want to be a miracle.
[14:56] And you love me as the beginning.
[15:03] Why you think?
[15:07] Why you don't love me more?
[15:11] Why you are doing this with me?
[15:14] It's not something that I want to do, Claudia.
[15:19] It's not something I talk to.
[15:21] It's not something that I want to do.
[15:23] Because you are poor now.
[15:26] And you say that you make and say another thing.
[15:30] Try to think inside you.
[15:33] What do you want in life?
[15:35] Why you are not...
[15:38] I don't know.
[15:39] Do you change all the time you think?
[15:41] No, I don't change.
[15:42] I am just feeling.
[15:47] But only about you.
[15:49] You don't think as a family.
[15:52] You don't think as a couple.
[15:54] Actually, you're two boys.
[15:57] This is my family.
[15:59] And me too.
[16:00] Yes?
[16:01] Because now I am your family too.
[16:04] Yes, but I can say nothing here.
[16:07] Zero.
[16:09] I have no words.
[16:11] It's not about you.
[16:13] And I mean anything.
[16:16] You hardly know.
[16:19] You say your words.
[16:21] You say it.
[16:23] You can't go.
[16:24] You can't try to find another.
[16:26] How do you find love?
[16:29] I'm a family here.
[16:31] I have nothing here.
[16:33] You are all for me.
[16:35] And when you say that,
[16:37] what do you think that I feel?
[16:40] I was in afraid.
[16:42] It was maybe also a wrong way to say it.
[16:45] Sorry for that too.
[16:47] But we are not having a happy day.
[16:56] We are not having a happy life.
[16:58] We are not...
[17:10] We have very, very different culture.
[17:16] We...
[17:28] Listen to me.
[17:30] And look at me please.
[17:34] Look at me.
[17:36] What?
[17:38] I'm going to pay the fee for family magnification.
[17:44] I'm going to...
[17:47] If I have to sell my...
[17:51] Or I'm going to do that.
[17:55] But when I began to get the exams
[18:00] and they come back,
[18:02] you are going to give me this.
[18:04] I'm not going to steal money from people.
[18:07] No, I am talking now with you.
[18:09] Yeah.
[18:10] Clearly.
[18:11] Okay?
[18:12] And when I get the documents,
[18:16] okay?
[18:18] If you don't love me more,
[18:22] assign feeling now.
[18:25] Okay?
[18:26] It's not.
[18:28] No.
[18:29] Please, and I'm going to begin to work fast.
[18:33] Okay?
[18:34] I'm going to, with this money,
[18:36] rent and a small apartment
[18:39] for Juanjo José Carlos.
[18:43] Okay?
[18:46] And me, if you don't want to be with me more,
[18:50] okay?
[18:51] But they can't live alone, Claus.
[18:53] Okay?
[18:54] Okay?
[18:55] If you accept me,
[18:58] okay.
[19:00] But you make me feel as I am a...
[19:03] If it's strong in your life.
[19:06] Okay.
[19:08] No, Claus, yeah.
[19:09] That's not the way you should think about this.
[19:11] And I'm going...
[19:13] You should think this way.
[19:18] People meet, they have the best intentions.
[19:22] They start a life together.
[19:26] They discover that the reality was not what they were imagining.
[19:37] The things changed.
[19:40] It's not that you are a wrong person.
[19:43] It's not that you are a bad person.
[19:46] I know you are a good person.
[19:50] I know you are a good person.
[19:53] Okay, so...
[19:54] Maybe it's me who are destroyed inside.
[19:59] I don't know.
[20:01] Because I put...
[20:05] I pray all the days of Rosario...
[20:08] Yes, I pray.
[20:10] And I don't believe about God's Claudia.
[20:13] I believe that we have to pay the bills.
[20:16] I told you this before.
[20:18] For me, it's nonsense.
[20:20] I'm going to...
[20:22] That is one of the other things we are not the same.
[20:24] I'm going to begin to work.
[20:26] Okay?
[20:29] I'm going to begin to work in Mars.
[20:33] I don't want to do anything bad, Claudia.
[20:36] No matter what.
[20:40] Don't destroy it.
[20:44] The future of my boys, please.
[20:48] I am not having...
[20:51] I don't want to destroy anyone, Claudia.
[20:57] I don't want to destroy anyone.
[21:37] I am still a little bit...
[21:42] I also have feelings for you, Claudia.
[21:46] But not in the right way.
[22:07] I'm going to do that.
[22:09] Okay?
[22:12] In Mars, my friends promised me that she's going to help me to find a job.
[22:36] I'm going to find a place for my boys.
[22:51] They don't want to disturb your life.
[22:56] They have to do their own life.
[23:01] I don't want to do it.
[23:07] But nothing I can do.
[23:10] I have the money for them.
[23:26] Just meeting me.
[23:31] What?
[23:34] Just meeting me.
[23:37] I want to read when I have to pay.
[23:41] Where I come?
[23:45] Please.
[24:25] I have to do something.
[24:32] Claudia, I will end like my father.
[24:44] I promised my boys, not.
[24:51] How did you do it?
[24:54] You want to kill me?
[24:59] Yes.
[25:22] Because I am pushed to the limits, Claudia.
[25:38] But when I begin to work, I am going to help you.
[25:48] I don't want you to have problems with the economy.
[25:55] I know, Claudia.
[25:58] I am not blaming you for that.
[26:01] It's just another reality.
[26:03] I don't have money, Claudia.
[26:08] But leave this.
[26:10] I am not a way.
[26:12] You are losing all your money with people who maybe, I don't know, they are not your friends.
[26:25] My head is exploding, Claudia.
[26:29] I have two main things inside of my head with political.
[26:38] I am so stressed, I want to run away, Claudia.
[26:42] Give me my auto cam by having a driving away, alone, quiet place without noise.
[26:49] The next three years, my head is big.
[26:57] But no one listens to me, doesn't it?
[27:07] I just receive all of this shit, more and more and more and more.
[27:13] Give me.
[27:18] I am dead.
[27:21] I am already dead, Claudia, inside.
[27:30] I was not like this 20 years ago.
[27:49] Please, when you go, send me that name, okay?
[27:53] Yes.
[27:54] I want to know what stress is.
[27:57] I want to help you.
[27:59] Do you know what stress is?
[28:01] Yes.
[28:02] Do you?
[28:03] No.
[28:04] No.
[28:05] I only want to help.
[28:07] Yes.
[28:08] Explaining from the morning to the evening every day to a person who is in a big stress is the same as giving it person.
[28:35] Okay.
[28:40] I told you other day I don't know what to do, Claudia.
[29:01] First of all, lift this group of trading because you want to sell your machines, you want to sell your things, you are losing all your money there.
[29:32] For me, it's disrespectful that you don't accept the reality.
[29:43] When I show you the picture about what's happening in the toilet.
[29:47] Are you, this is more important?
[29:49] No.
[29:50] No one.
[29:51] No, no, no.
[29:53] Now we start to talk this way and this way.
[29:56] I want to take a pill.
[30:00] I'm begging you, it's not.
[30:06] What you did and even told me if you think it's okay to do it, what is it?
[30:19] No, it's not okay.
[30:21] No, but you didn't say anything.
[30:23] I didn't say that it's not okay.
[30:25] You have the reason.
[30:31] I wanted to say it's okay, it's true.
[30:44] Forgive me.
[30:47] It's not about forgiveness, it's about that I have to prove
[30:54] I have to discuss, I have to express just to show a little thing about that thing happening in the toilet.
[31:12] Then you still don't believe it.
[31:30] You can leave this I can clean to late over here.
[31:33] Let me do it.
[31:37] It's not because I want to be a bad man.

      I am starting to get mental illness, Claudia.

    [03:39 - 03:41] Severidad: BAJA
      Nothing wrong, Claudia.

    [03:45 - 03:49] Severidad: BAJA
      We are two different, Claudia.

    [04:12 - 04:17] Severidad: BAJA
      We are two different, Claudia.

    [04:39 - 04:44] Severidad: BAJA
      I don't want to fight, but I have to be honest too, Claudia.

    [08:51 - 08:53] Severidad: BAJA
      Yes, I know Claudia.

    [08:58 - 09:02] Severidad: BAJA
      We are two different Claudia.

    [09:14 - 09:18] Severidad: BAJA
      But the reality is another Claudia.

    [15:14 - 15:19] Severidad: BAJA
      It's not something that I want to do, Claudia.

    [20:10 - 20:13] Severidad: BAJA
      And I don't believe about God's Claudia.

    [20:33 - 20:36] Severidad: BAJA
      I don't want to do anything bad, Claudia.

    [20:51 - 20:57] Severidad: BAJA
      I don't want to destroy anyone, Claudia.

    [21:42 - 21:46] Severidad: BAJA
      I also have feelings for you, Claudia.

    [24:32 - 24:44] Severidad: BAJA
      Claudia, I will end like my father.

    [25:22 - 25:28] Severidad: BAJA
      Because I am pushed to the limits, Claudia.

    [25:55 - 25:58] Severidad: BAJA
      I know, Claudia.

    [26:03 - 26:08] Severidad: BAJA
      I don't have money, Claudia.

    [26:25 - 26:29] Severidad: BAJA
      My head is exploding, Claudia.

    [26:38 - 26:42] Severidad: BAJA
      I am so stressed, I want to run away, Claudia.

    [27:21 - 27:30] Severidad: BAJA
      I am already dead, Claudia, inside.

    [28:40 - 29:01] Severidad: BAJA
      I told you other day I don't know what to do, Claudia.
