 I am not in the fantasy world in Peru and I am not in the fantasy world here I know I am working here. I am doing things because I know what is my responsibility I hate myself I hate myself Can you give me some please? Nothing changed, Claudio. Nothing. It's continuing. We are good persons, Lars. We are... We don't want to do nothing wrong. Please. But I don't want to sit on the toilet. It's so disgusting. I don't know what is happening the last time. I have bacteria all over me. I don't know where the piss is. It's maybe all over. But you accept that that's normal. No, I am not accepting that. It's very nice to sit on the toilet. And all you don't know where the pisses walk around and put the fingers in your mouth after that. Very delicious. And this has not changed. It's the same. We talked about this a year. Nothing is changed. Please, what? No, no, no. My boy can stand up and piss. Continue, stand up, pissing all over. He don't need to sit down to piss because he is my boy. Of course he can stand up and piss all over. No, no problem. I told him to... And I said, please. Please. You have to sit down to the piss. And what would happen? He said that he was doing it, but now I have to remember him on the other side. And now he is lying again. No, I have to remember him. So you think he is able to sit down and piss on the floor? No. Okay, so he is lying again? No. Please, can you move forward? He is not lying. One of the most important things I learned my children. Never lie. No matter what you never lie, then you are not a part of this family. Yeah. Why? Because if you can't do that, you have no respect for no other people. Yeah, but... Now he can do whatever he wants because he is protected from his mother. But he is not lying. He is... He is not a monster. This is a problem. I don't want peace on the house. Yo. Mess up? Why are you looking at this? And then... We put him down.
