 I don't accept that you have used me for lying. And I don't accept that you have used to my boy for lying. Okay. That tree is the same. No, it's not. Because I have no reason to destroy my own house. Maybe, maybe you have. No. Yes, maybe you have. No. Yes, because at last time when this happened, immediately you say, okay, I can accept that continually with people who is doing that. No. So I can't understand what you are doing this again because... It's not me doing it. I don't accept that you accuse me of lying. No, I don't accept that you accuse us. Then I think you have to find a solution. But we find it because this is showing me so much disrespect that I can't accept. We didn't. And that's all. We didn't. I know, I didn't do it. And there was no other people here. And I can't accept that my house will keep on being destroyed. Final. No. This is the final time. Someone in this house is lying. And it's not me. And if you accuse me for doing that one more time, you can find with your voice another place to stay. I don't accept because I am not destroying my own house. That's finished. No. You are accusing us and this is not true, okay? Not true. No. Not true. There's no one in this house. No. No. No. My pressure. I don't care about this. I know that you don't care about my health. Exactly. Because now you are accusing me for something that is insane. You are making me feel anxious. Yeah. And you make me feel a lot of things too. You don't care. Many days I am saying that my pressure is high and you don't mind. Then go to the hospital. Yeah. I want to go. Please. Yeah. Go. To cast them. You know that I can't drive because I have a problem. And you have a friend you can call. You can call one, one, two. Okay. I am going to call. Yes. Call the police too. Again. Call the police. I am going to call the police. Yes. Do that. Yeah. Thank you. I don't accept this. It's not fair. It's not fair. No, it's not fair. What are you doing with that? But no, you are not. You are not. Because for that exactly the reason you have a problem with your own voice. Because if your own voice don't want to, you are hard with my voice. Because they are not your voice. Yes. Yes. Yes. Do you make them feel bad? They are nervous. They are anxious. Because you are all the time they are accusing them. And it's not true. Problem. And yes, I know that you are not too proud because you don't care. You don't care. No, but we are not. We didn't. Okay. We didn't. So who did it? Mr. No one. No, Mr. Lars, you didn't. You didn't. You did it. Yes, because you know that but you want to make me feel crazy. You want to make me feel crazy. Yeah. You might have this bad for you. Okay, stop. Okay. Okay. Okay.
