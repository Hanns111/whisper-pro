 The 16th the club was 13, 12, 11. I can't remember, I'm stressed out. I'm so stressed out, I want to die. Can you please shoot me with a gun? Then I have peace. Find that doctor who can kill me, please. I want to die, Claudia. Nurse, I'll say that please. Nurse. I can't... If you... How... A camp we need to pay this. You can read the makes, I don't know. Yeah, it's in the media. Send me this. Send me this. And I am... I am starting to get mental illness, Claudia. Because... Yeah, but you say that you feel stressed because you haven't the money for pay this. And I can do something, I can talk. At home with my friends that they said me the money for pay that. Please. I come from one big cash. Yeah, but... You don't listen to how my life has been. More than... More than 15 years. With one big cash. But it's more than 15 years. But with the other. And now I continue with the next. But this is not my responsibility. No, but it's just to express that I am not an animal too. I am an human too. I am a human too. I lost. I lost. So many things you don't believe. I didn't see my boys. I lost my genitals. I lost and lost. I fight and fight for the freedom and people. And who is the only one destroying the money, the soul, the brain, me? Yeah, Lars, but listen to me please. This about a family of re-efficient. It's very important for me and the boys, you know. And it's due to... You say that you received this email a long time ago? I didn't open it. I didn't see it before now. Okay, so we can resolve this. Please. I can pay for that. Okay. I can pay for that. I want to begin to work. And... And if... When we get that... The residents, maybe you don't want to be more about me, but I don't know what I did. That nothing broke. No, you did not. Nothing wrong, Claudia. We are just two different. We are two different, Claudia. I don't want to criticize. But I can't accept destroying my house and you have a boy I know who do it. And you say he don't lie. Now I have evidence this is happening in the South. We are two different, Claudia. Can we try to have a good time in the next month, please? I don't want to find out. I don't want to be a good person. I don't want to fight, but I have to be honest too, Claudia. I am very, very pressed because I was coming from one house. I survived. I built this house up for me and my boys. I lost my boys. I struggled with my company in a long time. I struggled with my economy, but I did all this alone. And for the first time in many years I could sit down in my tier without having nice, without having problems. I feel safe. I could relax inside. And now I did something stupid things. And now I have economic problems. I don't know how to do. I am tired. I am tired. I am tired into my bones. I am tired of politics. I am tired of explaining. I am tired of discussing who did the walls or not did the walls in the toilet. I have to explain everything thousands times how to cook a potato is put into water and heat it up. Holy Christ. I have the responsibility of everything here. I don't have the economy. I have no work. I lost my job. I lost my economy. I can't run the company. I lost the money and the trading. I lost my temperance. What possibilities do I have? I am destroyed in my head. A physical I am destroyed. Now I am nervous inside like a dead man. You look me in the eyes and I am already dead. The spirit has left my body. There is nothing left. I fight it all the way. I am an empty cello. And then I have to discuss with you who did the walls in the kitchen in the toilet. I don't want to do this. No, but I don't want that people they destroy my house is disrespectful. Lars, do you know? There is no explanation for that. No, no, no. I know. He is lying and you accept it. Lars, okay. He is not about okay. You say one thing you mean a lot. My son has a disability. He is an autistic expert. Yes, I know. You have told me that seven thousand times. I want to do all the things okay. I always try to do that. I am angry with me and the boys. I try to be honest with them. But now? I was trying to sleep in the sofa and in the second floor he was... He was looking at me. I am more with him. What I say is not true. No, it's not true what I say. Again I lie. No, I don't say that. I am a liar again. What I say is not true. No, please. I don't say nothing. What I say is not true. This is not my reality. The war was here before. The picture was something I did in many forlaces in the computer. No, forgive me. I said nothing wrong. I really want to do all the things okay for us. Yes, I know Claudia. I know. But the truth that maybe you don't love me anymore. We are two different Claudia. But Lars, did you know all of this about this where we know us? Maybe I was dreaming. But the reality is another Claudia. You can blame me all you want. It was maybe my fault. Because I shouldn't have... I was maybe... I don't know. I was maybe dreaming that everything will be wonderful for me and for you and the boys and everything will be happy family. I was having an illusion. Maybe I listened too much to your words and I believe that... And maybe it's me inside, destroyed. Maybe, maybe, maybe. And I don't want to talk about all things happening. But what was happening in the start with your alcohol? Holy Christ. Lars, I don't drink nothing. No. No. I know. And I have a problem with alcohol. No. And we need to talk about all the things that you are telling now. Because it's important for me and my boys now. Because we are humans. And we are thinking in our future too. Yes. Because the Carlos isn't schooled. Yes. And if you don't want nothing with us, okay? Because I think that you are doing all this... speaking for tell me something. Okay? But if you don't want nothing with us, please. We now are in the process and we want... be the opportunity to be here. But I am doing all my best because I have feelings for you. But I think that you don't want to my boys. So, okay. We are trying to go when I get a job. I can rent some space for them. Okay? Okay. This is it to say now I love you. And tomorrow I don't love you. I'm not sure. Maybe I get a mistake. No, it's not fair. It's not fair for me. It's not fair for my children because we left all. I lost my job because I don't want to work anymore because I'm going to get married with my love of my life. I live my insurance of life after 17 years. I know. I live all. And now? And now? I am here waiting because I am not alone. I am not a lazy person. I want to work. I want to work. No, I want to say that. No, but you make me feel that I am a charge. That I am a big baggash for you now. That you feel stressed because you don't worry. You have it. And you make me feel that it's my fault. Sorry for that. You make me feel... Sorry for that. That's not the point for me. Sorry. But you make me feel... Yes, but I say sorry. And now I say, OK. Maybe. You are not sure about your feelings because I am a responsible person with my feelings. I have not seen for me say today I love you and tomorrow say, oh, sorry. I make a mistake because I don't sure inside me. No, this is not a person mature. OK. I am not a moral girl. I mean, not an adolescent. I am a woman. I can say that. No, but I am talking with you now as a couple. I am talking with you now that you can't do that with me because you are destroying my feelings. Or I am respect you. I respect you. I don't speak with nothing because I love you. I don't need to talk with another person. I respect to my husband. I respect my family. I am doing all that the things that I have with love. I cook for you. And I, not because it's my responsibility because I want to make you happy. I always think what would you like to eat? I know plenty. And you do that very well. I have nothing to claim about you. I bring all the days for us because I want to be a miracle. And you love me as the beginning. Why you think? Why you don't love me more? Why you are doing this with me? It's not something that I want to do, Claudia. It's not something I talk to. It's not something that I want to do. Because you are poor now. And you say that you make and say another thing. Try to think inside you. What do you want in life? Why you are not... I don't know. Do you change all the time you think? No, I don't change. I am just feeling. But only about you. You don't think as a family. You don't think as a couple. Actually, you're two boys. This is my family. And me too. Yes? Because now I am your family too. Yes, but I can say nothing here. Zero. I have no words. It's not about you. And I mean anything. You hardly know. You say your words. You say it. You can't go. You can't try to find another. How do you find love? I'm a family here. I have nothing here. You are all for me. And when you say that, what do you think that I feel? I was in afraid. It was maybe also a wrong way to say it. Sorry for that too. But we are not having a happy day. We are not having a happy life. We are not... We have very, very different culture. We... Listen to me. And look at me please. Look at me. What? I'm going to pay the fee for family magnification. I'm going to... If I have to sell my... Or I'm going to do that. But when I began to get the exams and they come back, you are going to give me this. I'm not going to steal money from people. No, I am talking now with you. Yeah. Clearly. Okay? And when I get the documents, okay? If you don't love me more, assign feeling now. Okay? It's not. No. Please, and I'm going to begin to work fast. Okay? I'm going to, with this money, rent and a small apartment for Juanjo José Carlos. Okay? And me, if you don't want to be with me more, okay? But they can't live alone, Claus. Okay? Okay? If you accept me, okay. But you make me feel as I am a... If it's strong in your life. Okay. No, Claus, yeah. That's not the way you should think about this. And I'm going... You should think this way. People meet, they have the best intentions. They start a life together. They discover that the reality was not what they were imagining. The things changed. It's not that you are a wrong person. It's not that you are a bad person. I know you are a good person. I know you are a good person. Okay, so... Maybe it's me who are destroyed inside. I don't know. Because I put... I pray all the days of Rosario... Yes, I pray. And I don't believe about God's Claudia. I believe that we have to pay the bills. I told you this before. For me, it's nonsense. I'm going to... That is one of the other things we are not the same. I'm going to begin to work. Okay? I'm going to begin to work in Mars. I don't want to do anything bad, Claudia. No matter what. Don't destroy it. The future of my boys, please. I am not having... I don't want to destroy anyone, Claudia. I don't want to destroy anyone. I am still a little bit... I also have feelings for you, Claudia. But not in the right way. I'm going to do that. Okay? In Mars, my friends promised me that she's going to help me to find a job. I'm going to find a place for my boys. They don't want to disturb your life. They have to do their own life. I don't want to do it. But nothing I can do. I have the money for them. Just meeting me. What? Just meeting me. I want to read when I have to pay. Where I come? Please. I have to do something. Claudia, I will end like my father. I promised my boys, not. How did you do it? You want to kill me? Yes. Because I am pushed to the limits, Claudia. But when I begin to work, I am going to help you. I don't want you to have problems with the economy. I know, Claudia. I am not blaming you for that. It's just another reality. I don't have money, Claudia. But leave this. I am not a way. You are losing all your money with people who maybe, I don't know, they are not your friends. My head is exploding, Claudia. I have two main things inside of my head with political. I am so stressed, I want to run away, Claudia. Give me my auto cam by having a driving away, alone, quiet place without noise. The next three years, my head is big. But no one listens to me, doesn't it? I just receive all of this shit, more and more and more and more. Give me. I am dead. I am already dead, Claudia, inside. I was not like this 20 years ago. Please, when you go, send me that name, okay? Yes. I want to know what stress is. I want to help you. Do you know what stress is? Yes. Do you? No. No. I only want to help. Yes. Explaining from the morning to the evening every day to a person who is in a big stress is the same as giving it person. Okay. I told you other day I don't know what to do, Claudia. First of all, lift this group of trading because you want to sell your machines, you want to sell your things, you are losing all your money there. For me, it's disrespectful that you don't accept the reality. When I show you the picture about what's happening in the toilet. Are you, this is more important? No. No one. No, no, no. Now we start to talk this way and this way. I want to take a pill. I'm begging you, it's not. What you did and even told me if you think it's okay to do it, what is it? No, it's not okay. No, but you didn't say anything. I didn't say that it's not okay. You have the reason. I wanted to say it's okay, it's true. Forgive me. It's not about forgiveness, it's about that I have to prove I have to discuss, I have to express just to show a little thing about that thing happening in the toilet. Then you still don't believe it. You can leave this I can clean to late over here. Let me do it. It's not because I want to be a bad man.
