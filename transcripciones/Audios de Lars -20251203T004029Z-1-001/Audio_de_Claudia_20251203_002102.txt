 What a special moment, seeing Chouandiget off the bus, rode two or eight-ing-strap and walk all the way home completely on his own is proof of tremendous progress. For most people, it's just an ordinary trip but for my son, who is on the autism spectrum, this is the most important step toward his personal independence. He did it all by himself, from school to our front door, through the Danish autumn, an example of courage. A thousand thanks to the professional team and the school for making this dream possible. Your support means everything. I am endlessly proud of you, Juan Di. I love you.
