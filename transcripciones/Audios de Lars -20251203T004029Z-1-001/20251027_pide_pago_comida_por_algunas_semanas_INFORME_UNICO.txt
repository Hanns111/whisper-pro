B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] Oh, here you go.
[00:07] Okay.
[00:15] Okay.
[00:22] I called my Norwegian company.
[00:41] I go to them to a meeting today.
[00:46] It's number one thing.
[00:53] You want to try to see to help me.
[00:57] Maybe I paid a little too much tax money in.
[01:01] We can stop to pay more tax for this year or get something back.
[01:06] We have to look on that.
[01:09] I get a little salary from my own company to my private account every month.
[01:19] But the company do not earn money.
[01:23] So I can't keep on doing that.
[01:31] Because then I have to put the money back again into the account.
[01:36] And I just pay more and more tax.
[01:42] We go into a half a meeting with this.
[01:44] Try to make the best solution with that.
[01:47] That's number one info.
[01:49] Number two info.
[01:51] I called my bank.
[01:54] I didn't tell them everything.
[01:57] I just told him that in December my mother gave us, you can see, she did.
[02:03] The last two years and we will have again.
[02:06] It's the same bank.
[02:09] Okay.
[02:10] And I ask him what can we talk about?
[02:17] And he can give me an extra bracket of 50,000 Danish Kroner.
[02:30] 25 on my private account and 25 on my company account.
[02:42] So with the 50,000 I can have them in 45 days.
[02:53] And then I will get hopefully my mother's money.
[03:00] Let's say I didn't pay 10,000 for bills.
[03:05] We have 40 left.
[03:10] I am going to put those money into the investments.
[03:20] If I calculate 40,000 with the investments like it, no.
[03:32] That was too quickly for me.
[03:35] Sorry.
[03:38] I have one to wash my clothes.
[04:08] If I am going to invest 40,000 I only use 25% of the 40,000 to actually trade with it.
[04:33] That is 10,000.
[04:38] Those 10,000 giving a profit for one week of 140%.
[04:46] You can see the calculation here.
[04:50] And after one week the total will be 24,000.
[05:15] And this is in the best scenery.
[05:21] This is the scenery we had this week.
[05:24] And this week was not especially good.
[05:28] What happened if you lost that?
[05:33] It's only a question.
[05:40] But you know, because I don't know about this.
[05:46] So if you consider that this is the way, but the banks accept finally.
[05:54] They don't know I do this here.
[05:57] I don't know.
[05:58] But they accept to give me more credit.
[06:04] In 45 days.
[06:08] I have to credit in 45 days.
[06:11] And then my mother's money arrives.
[06:15] I want to take something here.
[06:33] We see an investor T-Toucher owner, offers a profit for one or two percent.
[06:40] But my extra money higher so will over the T-Toucher.
[07:03] That's not true.
[07:19] I will say that I will say that it is still a T-Toucher owner.
[07:26] And I will profit for one or three thousand.
[07:30] But my higher so will over the T-Toucher.
[07:56] I will say that I will profit for one or three thousand.
[08:06] And I will say that I will profit for one or three thousand.
[08:14] Thank you.
[08:45] Yes.
[08:48] A profit of doing this investment with ten thousand owner is fourteen thousand owner.
[09:12] If we have this salary, Claudia, we don't go this way.
[09:21] We will go this way.
[09:36] I told you.
[09:45] Do you understand clearly?
[09:48] Yes.
[09:50] Completely.
[09:52] Yes, your idea.
[09:54] Also the numbers.
[09:56] How you explain?
[10:06] Can you see this?
[10:23] I know what you think.
[10:26] There is two way to earn money in this life.
[10:30] Work your ass off.
[10:33] Work your ass off.
[10:36] Do you think I will be able to get this kind of income for work one week?
[10:47] It will be impossible, Claudia.
[11:01] I understand how you say.
[11:11] You have the knowledge I don't know about this.
[11:20] But you are explaining me, if you consider all the risks and you have the control,
[11:36] and you are ability for involved financially in this.
[11:48] I only can give you all the time my emotional support because I want the best for you, for us.
[11:59] Always.
[12:01] And I don't want to see you sad.
[12:03] I don't want to see you nervous.
[12:06] But if I don't do anything now, I don't know what will happen with me.
[12:18] When I look all around me and think in reality,
[12:35] there is no better solution than this.
[12:45] That is very clear.
[12:53] The only thing is that I need to do this training.
[12:59] I need to sit here those hours from early to late when they start.
[13:08] And be very, very specific and follow this here.
[13:15] And don't over-invest, don't take big risks, don't do anything mistakes.
[13:25] Now you can laugh at me.
[13:34] If I can sit here and be focused and have my time,
[13:40] I'm sure this year will be happening.
[13:44] And then if you look on this number and say,
[13:51] this is the most important.
[13:57] This is your work.
[14:01] Because if I say, oh no, I have to, I have to go out to repair a little thing and earn 100 kroner.
[14:11] And then I lost the possibility of earning 2000.
[14:18] Do you understand?
[14:22] And I understand your feelings.
[14:27] So I need my time, I need my space to say now, it's 3 o'clock.
[14:34] I have to stay here.
[14:36] I don't want you to look at me and say that you don't do anything here.
[14:46] You need to cook, you need to do this because.
[14:53] And I don't want to fight about this here.
[14:57] Lars.
[14:59] And I don't want to...
[15:04] I want you to understand Claudia.
[15:08] I understand.
[15:11] Let's take an example. One day I sit here, push the buttons, two traits.
[15:27] We make money, of course we do.
[15:37] If I go out to do a little service, I run only a little.
[15:45] If I'm focused here.
[15:51] What?
[15:52] Do you understand?
[15:53] Yes, and I have a question.
[15:56] What do you expect about me?
[15:58] That I respect your times.
[16:01] And I can't do that because I always respect your time.
[16:05] And if you need an extra help, I can do...
[16:09] I only wish that you be calm.
[16:14] The thing is that I don't...
[16:17] I want to take as much control and risk control as ever possible.
[16:26] So that requires that when they give me the system, now it's time.
[16:30] I'm going to go sit here.
[16:33] Look, follow.
[16:35] Is it going correctly?
[16:39] And if I see something go wrong, I can stop it because I am focused here.
[16:45] I'm not standing out there drinking coffee or...
[16:49] You know, away because the market you see, it goes.
[16:56] Okay?
[16:58] And I can't do two hours of cooking when I don't know what's happening here with my money.
[17:06] I invest with my risk.
[17:12] Do you think we can agree about this without looking with bad eyes?
[17:22] Of course.
[17:24] And you know that I am doing my best.
[17:27] I am happy because I am...
[17:29] I don't say I am just crying.
[17:35] To be very honest, that for me it's also about what I feel.
[17:41] Because let's say another thing out here, if you was not here and I knew I have to do this,
[17:51] then I will just take a little breath and put something on place here and drink my coffee and eat.
[17:57] I don't care because this is my work, this is my money, this is no.
[18:05] I have the opportunities.
[18:08] If I don't push the button, the right time,
[18:18] it's like going to work without an early and anacelary.
[18:25] And the situation with our economy is going like this now.
[18:33] And this is the surface.
[18:36] We need to change this country.
[18:40] Really.
[18:44] But I don't want...
[18:46] I want that you know what's going on.
[18:49] I want to know that we can make this agreement. That's how it is.
[19:04] My instant, I was...
[19:08] So of course, if there is calling me, can you go to do a little job for me here?
[19:14] And I can do that before 3 o'clock.
[19:17] I will do that of course and take those money too.
[19:24] But I will not because this here I earn 10 times more with my time investment.
[19:33] Yeah.
[19:35] I understand you.
[19:39] I am doing my things.
[19:41] I am trying to do my aunt's things.
[19:46] That's good too, Claudia.
[19:48] Because you need your time.
[19:50] I need my time.
[19:51] But that's not, that means that we can share time together when you come and when I come.
[19:57] No, but right now we have an economy-can-situations.
[20:01] We have to take very, very seriously close.
[20:04] Exactly.
[20:05] And then this is priority number one.
[20:10] When I say share, I don't say spend money.
[20:14] I say share maybe.
[20:16] But I respect. I am totally ready with you.
[20:20] I have many things to do here.
[20:23] I want, for example, I go with a computer to the second floor because
[20:28] I want to study, I want to do a speak.
[20:33] I can sit in the table and when I go through.
[20:38] And I can study quite and come.
[20:43] I don't need to stay in front of you when you are doing this because maybe you disturb me and I disturb you.
[20:50] Yeah, no, but in the start when I did this here, there was an obligation on me that I should
[20:58] buy the food, I should do all the food in the same time I have to do the trading.
[21:03] And it was impossible for me to go to the next floor.
[21:05] And now it's not necessary because now I can cook.
[21:12] So I am happy because each day I am giving a little step more.
[21:23] I do it for my own, for my own that is hurt.
[21:29] I cook and I can continue doing that because today this was a goal for me.
[21:39] Because now I can learn.
[21:43] Of course you can cook.
[21:45] Yes, of course and I am doing.
[21:48] But you have two hands, you have eyes, you have ears.
[21:53] So of course you can.
[21:55] People who say they can't cook, I say holy Christ.
[22:00] Yeah, but I am doing.
[22:03] I am happy because I am doing.
[22:07] The problem is that the time when the sickness is coming is around.
[22:14] You know how it is, three o'clock and maybe two eleven.
[22:19] And that's how it is.
[22:25] But I prefer to do this because I know there is money in this and there is a lot of money.
[22:33] I can't work the same money out in the reality.
[22:40] It's impossible.
[22:43] And I will not, if I work with my back, 80 hours, you saw me working, taking templates every day.
[22:51] It's not, I like my work.
[22:55] But this, this here, and I have been looking on this here, Claudia.
[23:03] Thank you for sharing your feelings.
[23:06] Thank you for sharing what are you thinking?
[23:10] And thank you for sharing what is your plan.
[23:14] Because I understand it.
[23:17] And we have now an agreement about this.
[23:21] I am going to respect your time.
[23:25] I have to do two things here.
[23:30] And this is my 50% in this house.
[23:36] Maybe it's 80% now.
[23:38] In a time, Claudia.
[23:40] I can't do it.
[23:42] For example, I have...
[23:45] First of all, we have to agree that this here is the most highest priority because...
[23:50] And when do you think that you can be able to do that?
[23:56] From...
[24:00] Hopefully tomorrow.
[24:04] But tomorrow I have to go to a election meeting.
[24:09] Yeah.
[24:11] I only have a question because now you say that you are very busy.
[24:16] So that means that the appointment that I have is possible that I go alone.
[24:23] I can't remember what time it was.
[24:26] Maybe at 3 o'clock, 30 October.
[24:33] But maybe I will have my phone number.
[24:37] We can do like that.
[24:39] Or maybe if you have to do this at 3 o'clock,
[24:46] maybe only you can leave me there and I can come back on the bus.
[24:52] Because I was looking at the bus.
[24:55] I can just stay.
[24:58] I just need...
[25:00] I can do it from my phone too.
[25:04] If I have to.
[25:06] But normally, I would like to sit here with the control, the electricity.
[25:13] So nothing is going wrong.
[25:16] I sit here quiet.
[25:18] All is organized.
[25:20] For that reason, I...
[25:22] Instead of sitting in a room with a stress and what's going on and what will happen if I lose the power from the telephone.
[25:31] Yeah. For that reason, I would like that we have an agreement about this day.
[25:37] Because you are not going to be focused with your mobile.
[25:42] So maybe the best solution, because I want to be considering.
[25:51] Maybe...
[25:57] I have to wait for Juan Diego, because he arrived to 10th o'clock the bus.
[26:09] I can wait for him. He entered.
[26:12] I prepared all for his class.
[26:14] And maybe you can leave me before 3.
[26:18] I can wait.
[26:20] But you can come back at home before 3 o'clock.
[26:24] And I can wait there.
[26:26] And I can go by myself to the bus and come back in the bus.
[26:32] Maybe I can back around 5 o'clock because the last bus I was looking.
[26:37] It's also possible that I can drive for you, Claudia.
[26:41] Don't worry for me.
[26:43] If you want to help me to be more independent, let me do that.
[26:49] And I can...
[26:51] We can talk about that when we...
[26:53] I'm the situation, because it's not because everything is impossible.
[26:58] You just have to understand that.
[27:03] If I'm not focused, if I'm not doing this, you don't earn the money.
[27:09] Exactly.
[27:11] If you look on this here as the most important thing, as a work,
[27:19] you have to invest your time and your eyes and be.
[27:29] And then you can...
[27:31] This is the reality, Claudia.
[27:37] I have a question.
[27:39] If I decide to go, for example,
[27:42] because we'll happen,
[27:45] it's a possibility that you receive the signal early.
[27:49] And I never know.
[27:51] Exactly.
[27:53] If I go with my bicycle,
[27:57] I think that I should be driving around 30 minutes.
[28:02] If I want to come back, I can enter to the bus with my bicycle.
[28:09] It's possible that...
[28:19] I'm going to investigate the work.
[28:21] I'm not sure.
[28:23] I think, but I'm not sure.
[28:28] Always we can find solutions.
[28:38] That's easy to say, Claudia.
[28:41] It's the same as maybe there will be 25 degrees in January.
[28:45] No, it will not Claudia.
[28:52] I understand.
[28:54] I understand perfectly.
[28:57] I can give you my opinion about...
[29:00] Of course we can always give opinion.
[29:03] No, I mean that I can be involved in trading things
[29:11] because it's not my knowledge.
[29:13] So I can't give my opinion about if this is...
[29:17] Because I don't know.
[29:19] But I understand what you are explaining.
[29:23] And I'm going to give you my support
[29:28] with the things in the house if it's necessary 60, 70, 80%.
[29:35] In the time.
[29:38] In the time of course.
[29:47] Do you have a little budget?
[29:50] The next one, two weeks to help with the food.
[30:01] Or it's impossible.
[30:05] I am using my credit card.
[30:10] And that means what?
[30:14] That I...
[30:21] I am going to do my numbers too
[30:24] because I am paying the English teacher.
[30:30] I...
[30:34] Both the shoes and the jacket, the boys,
[30:40] with the credit card.
[30:43] I am paying that.
[30:46] And I am...
[30:50] I think that I can use my credit card in the next week too.
[30:58] As always.
[31:01] No, I ask you specific.
[31:04] What is possible and what is not possible?
[31:08] Because we...
[31:10] I don't want we go into next week or Friday
[31:13] and then we have cars about this too.
[31:15] We have to make a control about a plan.
[31:19] About all.
[31:21] Yeah, but take a go with the car.
[31:25] I can drive.
[31:28] I talk about the economy.
[31:32] How much is that?
[31:41] I don't know.
[31:43] You know when you buy the food last time.
[31:45] You know how much it was.
[31:51] But we have rises, low price.
[31:54] And we have potatoes.
[31:56] We have meat in the fridge.
[31:58] Of course we need to buy a little other things.
[32:01] Yeah, I can do a low budget.
[32:05] Yeah.
[32:08] Okay, for the next two weeks.
[32:13] I think something like that.
[32:16] Because if I need to take out more money from the investments,
[32:25] I will not win as much money.
[32:34] Do you understand?
[32:36] Yes.
[32:38] If I only invest 1000 homeless instead of 10,000 homeless,
[32:45] there's a big difference in the winning.
[32:49] You understand?
[32:51] Yeah.
[33:01] Hmm?
[33:08] Are you able to do this a little moment, Claudia?
[33:12] Yeah.
[33:13] Or what?
[33:14] Or is it totally impossible?
[33:16] No.
[33:17] I'm doing a risky tool, Claudia.
[33:24] Do you mean yes or do you say yes or mean no?
[33:28] No, I say that I can't in the next two weeks.
[33:32] Because if I use the money in the next two weeks,
[33:38] I is not David Carr.
[33:42] It's credit.
[33:44] So you don't have the money?
[33:46] I don't know what means with David and credit.
[33:49] Do you have money or do you not have money?
[33:52] No, I have it.
[33:53] But you have money.
[33:55] No.
[33:56] Zero.
[33:57] I am using the money that I receive from the rent.
[34:04] And you know that I have to pay.
[34:06] Yes.
[34:07] And I have a little and the money that Hans sent for the children.
[34:12] So this money I can use.
[34:15] So you have a...
[34:21] You have on your account or minus.
[34:30] I don't understand.
[34:31] Do you have plus on your account or minus?
[34:35] No, I am a half the money that Hans sent me.
[34:40] I know.
[34:41] Yes.
[34:42] And I can pay with this using my credit card.
[34:46] Because I use the credit card and when she...
[34:49] The question is do you have money or do you don't...
[34:52] Or don't you have money?
[34:54] No.
[34:55] I have the money that I receive for the rent.
[34:58] Yeah.
[34:59] But I also have the money I received from my rent, from my second house.
[35:03] Oh, huh.
[35:04] So the question is still the same.
[35:06] Do you have money?
[35:07] No matter where they are from.
[35:09] Yes or no?
[35:12] Yes.
[35:13] I have this money.
[35:15] But I need to use the money for pay.
[35:20] And I have a small yes for pay.
[35:24] How much do you have left over when you paid to the bank?
[35:33] Exactly.
[35:38] I mean that I have an accident around...
[35:48] That change of Hans sent me is around an accident about...
[36:00] 500 dollars.
[36:02] And with this I can pay.
[36:07] Okay.
[36:08] That's okay Claudia.
[36:10] Okay.
[36:13] Then I think we have a plan.
[36:21] Because we was on this way.
[36:24] Now I think we have a plan Claudia.
[36:27] But we have to help each other to do this in this way.
[36:34] I will feel much more comfortable when I have the money in my account.
[36:47] I can put me into the training because then I can see that this is moving.
[36:53] And I will feel much more comfortable.
[37:12] I wish the best for you, for us.
[37:17] I wish I could be able to work.
[37:24] Because when you...
[37:26] No, the reality is not that you are not going to work soon.
[37:30] You know that too.
[37:32] The reality is that we have to try to find a economy now.
[37:39] But I am going to work.
[37:41] Yes.
[37:42] But that will not be soon Claudia.
[37:44] You know that too.
[37:48] Do you think that it is not possible?
[37:52] When you say, soon I don't believe it Claudia.
[37:58] With the CPR, if I go to the job center...
[38:08] There will maybe be some possibilities for work Claudia.
[38:13] The next question is, do you want to have this work?
[38:17] What time do you have?
[38:19] You have a boy with disabilities.
[38:25] Maybe he can apply for some health.
[38:29] And this is going to help the economy.
[38:35] I don't know all the rules about this Claudia.
[38:38] I just know that I don't.
[38:41] You don't...
[38:45] You only have the time you have Claudia.
[38:48] You only also have the capacity you have.
[38:52] Mentally.
[38:55] We all only have 100% capacity.
[39:02] Mentally, energy, time.
[39:06] So dreaming about that I want to go to Hawaii today, be tomorrow.
[39:11] At work and the next day I want to fly to Miami.
[39:15] It's not possible.
[39:18] You will be very stressed if you have to go every morning with the childrens and work and buy food and take care of many things Claudia.
[39:45] Have you been thinking about this?
[39:51] Yes, but...
[39:54] Have you been thinking about that Claudia?
[39:57] Yes.
[40:00] Of course, yes.
[40:06] I am a strong person.
[40:11] Yes, I know that Claudia.
[40:16] But now...
[40:18] Or to see when people die.
[40:21] But now we need to be...
[40:23] Take too much energy out of the battery.
[40:25] But now...
[40:27] Don't you know what I mean?
[40:29] Yes.
[40:30] But now we need to be focused.
[40:32] Yes.
[40:33] Okay?
[40:34] So that's it for me.
[40:37] Don't worry.
[40:39] I only want to be quite calm with our stressful...
[40:48] Trying to be okay on the way.
[40:55] Stayed by a step.
[40:58] But this world is not easy.
[41:00] Yes.
[41:02] Now...
[41:11] I don't know me and you are not.
[41:13] We talk many times about that we are very, very unlucky.
[41:18] Do you know the word, what unlucky is?
[41:22] You can be lucky.
[41:25] You know what lucky is.
[41:27] You can also be the opposite.
[41:32] And actually me and you are not, we talk sometimes.
[41:35] We are afraid to wake up in the morning because...
[41:41] What is going to happen now?
[41:50] That's why it's very important that we have to do a change right now because...
[41:57] We don't know what is coming.
[42:04] Okay, I understand you.
[42:13] The good news is that we have things here for cook in the next days.
[42:18] That's only short time.
[42:20] I want to think long distance.
[42:25] Long time, Claudia, I look the law away.
[42:29] What is the solution?
[42:32] The solution is not continuing like we have to do.
[42:49] That was my words.
[42:55] And I have to realize I am living in another reality now.
[43:01] I have to find the budgets for my kids.
[43:05] I have to pay for them every month.
[43:09] And that is a big, big, expensive cost that I didn't have before.
[43:25] But with this idea, giving me the space,
[43:37] the feeling that is okay, I am sitting here because it's a part of the life.
[43:46] I will be more calm to say, okay, you accept?
[43:52] Because continuing in a situation with out of control and stress about what I do,
[44:06] that's not a life for me, Claudia.
[44:10] Then I will run away.
[44:13] One day I will take my auto cab and drive to...
[44:16] I don't know where I am running away.
[44:21] I can put a fire through this plate and I am away.
[44:24] I don't want to live that life.
[44:28] I am going to continue with my things.
[44:32] We can talk later about if you want to talk.
[44:37] But now, be quiet.
[44:41] Don't speak more about financial things.
[44:47] We can continue talking later.
[44:51] But we have an agreement now and you understand.
[44:56] I understand.
[45:07] I am too continue.
[45:12] Tomorrow you are going to do this.
[45:19] There is an election meeting tomorrow.
[45:27] I have to do a plan with that too to see.
[45:33] I can cook today.
[45:35] The only thing that I would like is how did you cook that?
[45:41] That's the only thing that I want to learn.
[45:44] I can do that in 10 minutes.
[45:47] It's not a problem.
[45:49] I come back in 15 minutes maybe for...
[45:53] I finish to do my things in the second floor and I can't help you cook the strawberries.
