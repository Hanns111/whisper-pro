B. TRANSCRIPCIÓN CON TIMELINE
================================================================================

[00:00] Strong solution
[00:07] And it's not because it's in panic
[00:12] It's not because it's the only way
[00:21] With this
[00:30] That trading
[00:42] Of course if there is a little job in my company
[00:46] I have a little possibility now to go to fix something in a house
[00:55] But if we look on the budget what we need for money and what I can earn
[01:00] It will only and time will run and I will get old
[01:08] If we want to have a life we can't live here Claudia
[01:12] We have to go like this
[01:16] But you know that trading is not a job
[01:20] And you have the control with trading
[01:24] It's in reality you have the control
[01:28] Because if I follow this sequence Claudia
[01:32] We see in this results
[01:37] Continue coming here
[01:50] If you are sure to
[01:52] I am 100% sure
[01:56] The only thing is that
[02:00] When you think I can do the trading on my own
[02:06] And now please listen I want you to understand clearly
[02:12] That you know in this life you can be lucky and unlucky
[02:18] But you are not a professional
[02:22] What can we say?
[02:26] I count money there
[02:28] You are not that I am not too
[02:30] And I am not a professional trader too
[02:34] That doesn't mean that you can't count
[02:38] That doesn't mean that I can't trade
[02:42] And many times it will go good for me
[02:44] Maybe 8 out of 10 times it will go good
[02:48] But no but 9 and 10 it goes really bad
[02:52] Because I don't have
[02:56] All the knowledge about this
[03:00] So for that reason I should not do that
[03:06] That's just very hard for a man
[03:10] Like me who want to grow
[03:14] And always do my own business
[03:18] Do you understand?
[03:20] But what I say is that I learned
[03:22] I accept
[03:24] And I know
[03:26] This is not the way
[03:30] Because you
[03:32] I am not intelligent professional for
[03:36] This area to know
[03:38] Will it go up?
[03:40] Will it go down?
[03:42] Because that's the only two things
[03:44] Can happen
[03:46] Those people working with this
[03:48] They are very very very professional
[03:50] We've seen the results so many times
[03:54] I think it will go up now
[03:58] I can look in the market
[04:00] I feel and I think and I think
[04:02] But then it goes the wrong way
[04:04] I am not professional
[04:06] I know that
[04:08] So if I want to make money
[04:12] If I want to do it in a safe way
[04:14] Especially in this situation now
[04:18] I have to follow the trading signals
[04:22] Do the two trades today
[04:24] Stop
[04:26] Close the computer
[04:28] That's it
[04:36] Do you understand what I say?
[04:42] Yes, I understand
[04:46] What is your feeling now?
[04:50] So...
[05:00] I am honest with you, Clowny
[05:02] About what I think
[05:04] About what I see
[05:06] What I learn
[05:08] What I know
[05:10] I also know that I am not professional
[05:12] But many times when I look
[05:16] And I have my...
[05:18] I am sitting and thinking
[05:20] What will happen
[05:22] Okay, I also believe it goes down
[05:24] Many times I am right
[05:26] But also sometimes I am wrong
[05:28] They are more professional
[05:30] That's how it is
[05:32] And I should not take the risk
[05:38] I am going to study
[05:44] Do you want to...
[05:46] Go ahead
[05:48] I am going to study
[05:50] Do you want to study?
[05:52] Yes
[05:54] Go ahead
[05:56] Go ahead
[06:02] Yes
[06:04] Yes, but I am not sure
[06:06] I am going to study here
[06:08] But I am going to study here
[06:10] I am going to study here
[06:12] I am going to study here
[06:14] Yes
[06:20] I will not say
[06:22] I am not sure
[06:24] I am not sure
[06:26] You are wrong
[06:30] That is my step
[06:34] But I am thinking
[06:36] There is two things
[06:42] We take the paint
[06:44] And see I have to learn about it
[06:46] And see how many paint is there
[06:48] That is what we have stopped
[06:50] Let's go
[07:02] You can see the paint is in the water
[07:04] So there is a lot of paint
[07:14] Yes, but
[07:16] It is very simple
[07:20] Because tinker
[07:21] and it is quite a big
[07:24] And a lot of paint
[07:28] What I have seen is very simple
[07:32] And in relation to cauldron
[07:34] The paint is not complete
[07:36] I was so frustrated
[07:38] I thought
[07:39] It happened
[07:40] That you could slide through
[07:44] The paint was looking good
[07:46] And
[07:50] We're going to take small
[07:52] two of these
[07:55] But it's always
[08:06] So it will get up at work
[08:08] �로 A little different
[08:09] But that'll be the case
[08:11] Cause that's the reason
[08:16] And i dont know...
[08:24] where i will go
[08:32] about the rule...
[08:35] User message
[08:39] i dont need to do it
[08:42] Do it
[08:42] then
[08:45] things would usually then stick with the pain
[08:51] and there'd also be subtle issues.
[08:57] it would have obviously been possible guys
[09:01] but that moved me
[09:04] somethings way weanst gotten this
[09:07] I have kind of a simulation that I don't look like a pain in my head,
[09:16] and apparently I beat the wall,
[09:19] how will I help with dread?
[09:30] And then we have to pay for the 30,000 today.
[09:37] Can we go to that?
[09:40] Because I also have a pen that is there,
[09:44] which can be used to get the balance in the thing.
[09:49] And then we have to pay for the balance in the thing.
[09:56] No, we have to pay for the balance in the thing.
[10:01] We have to pay for the balance in the thing.
[10:20] And then we have to pay for the balance in the thing.
[10:29] And then we have to pay for the balance in the thing.
[10:33] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:38] Do I call it your decision?
[10:44] I guess...
[10:53] So it's the one you are trying to put up all over the World.
[10:57] Okay, shut up!
[10:59] All right, lay on down.
[11:02] Yeah.
[11:08] Go, go, go.
