[00:00] Wg
[00:09] OK
[00:21] The telephone bill for War Wasnel
[00:23] 10.0, we received 10 voice, 1600, and 20.
[00:35] This is your bills?
[00:38] You know, you two boys and you have phones.
[00:41] Ah, the bill for the phones.
[00:44] Okay.
[00:46] 1620.
[00:49] 1000?
[00:50] 600.
[00:52] Why?
[00:54] Because...
[00:56] Claudia.
[00:58] Because we take a promotion, and it's 90, the first three months.
[01:04] Yeah.
[01:05] But Claudia, it's a waste of time discussing if this is right or not, if it is right.
[01:13] What I try to say is that there's many things Claudia.
[01:18] Okay.
[01:19] We have to do something.
[01:21] Yeah, we can change another phone.
[01:28] I try to let you understand the situation.
[01:34] Yeah.
[01:37] So, sitting here and drinking coffee will not solve the problem.
[01:49] We have to take some decisions.
[01:51] We have to do something.
[01:54] And this is not small changes we have to do.
[02:01] The investment, they make a plan, and they finished calculating every Sunday.
[02:09] Now, they earned 140%.
[02:15] Do you understand what I say?
[02:21] This is your...
[02:22] You are talking about your trade.
[02:24] Yeah.
[02:25] Okay.
[02:28] I don't see any other way, can't I?
[02:34] But we have to find some money to do the trading.
[02:45] I don't see any other way, Claudia.
[02:55] I already tried to talk with two of my friends if it was possible that they could give me some money.
[03:03] And then in December, I get some money from my mother, and I could give them back.
[03:09] People they say, no.
[03:12] They make a story that they don't have the money, but it's not true.
[03:25] I don't know what you think, but I...
[03:32] I might have been analyzing if I am thinking correct, Claudia, if I am being focused, I'm all.
[03:52] It's running away from us, Claudia.
[04:02] Then I've been thinking about I could also sell something, the green machine.
[04:12] The most important thing is actually to do it as quick as possible.
[04:23] I also think about selling the red car.
[04:35] I don't like it.
[04:39] I just don't know what to do, Claudia.
[04:44] I have maybe...
[04:50] I have to call another person I ask if this is possible for him.
[04:57] And I think they say no.
[05:03] And I don't feel comfortable inside when I can't see there is a solution for the future.
[05:10] It's okay to be a little down, and you have a solution.
[05:16] But keep on going down and don't have a solution.
[05:20] It makes me feel I can't accept.
[05:29] And we are there now.
[05:32] You need to analyze about the trait, your loss, and your losing statistic the one's way.
[05:43] But you need to analyze that.
[05:47] I did all my thinking.
[05:55] About the mobile, we talked at the beginning that we can stay three months with this company and after change.
[06:12] So we are on time to change.
[06:16] Because I remember that promotion.
[06:19] The first three months was 90 or 99.
[06:25] Corona is around 100 Corona for person.
[06:31] I am going to be responsible for that.
[06:47] And I know that you are going to find a way.
[06:56] I have never been in this situation in Claudia.
[07:06] Maybe you are two nirbles and stress because you lost a lot of money.
[07:27] Of course, I am with strength.
[07:32] But it's also that now I have bills, I should pay, I can't.
[07:38] Because you haven't done a amount of budget.
[07:41] No.
[07:42] Because you lost that.
[07:44] I know that.
[07:46] Please don't repeat it.
[07:48] No, no, no.
[07:49] Because this is not a solution.
[07:50] Yes.
[07:51] The solution is trying to find something to do.
[08:00] I can show you the picture.
[08:03] I don't know if you don't.
[08:06] No, I believe in all your words.
[08:09] Believe.
[08:10] And it is true and it is possible.
[08:31] You can look here, Claudia again.
[08:37] I've seen this so many times, Claudia.
[08:47] The problem, yeah, you know about this.
[08:51] I don't know about this.
[08:54] It's not my knowledge.
[08:58] I don't know.
[09:01] I understand that all this is a stress.
[09:26] But I am sure that you are going to find the solution too.
[09:32] Because you are not an adjunct man, you are an intelligent man.
[09:43] I know.
[09:52] When I say I am very hard to do the limit, Claudia.
[09:59] People bless you, listen to me.
[10:12] I want to be happy.
[10:14] I want to smile.
[10:15] I want to have a little freedom with some money.
[10:52] I want to be happy.
[10:58] I want to have a little freedom with some money.
[11:06] I want to have a little freedom with some money.
[11:13] And of course I am sad that all this is happening once over you.
[11:37] And of course I am sad that all this is happening once over you.
[11:43] But the last year there has been many, many extra things.
[12:06] And no luck with almost anything.
[12:36] I don't believe that it is any other way.
[12:43] And I mean it, Claudia.
[12:50] Any other way will just...
[12:57] We will never.
[13:05] Maybe you can help you or some money to all your sister.
[13:12] I don't know what to say.
[13:19] I am going to continue studying.
[13:22] Actually my sister was very angry when I told her that I have a problem.
[13:31] How do you think it is me she say?
[13:38] Her.
[13:46] My little sister, she has a lot of money but I know she will not hurt me.
[13:59] No, no.
[14:02] Maybe you can talk with her.
[14:04] Impossible.
[14:06] It is the same as asking for a good for my money.
[14:10] Try to do that to Claudia.
[14:16] And I know I did many mistakes Claudia.
[14:33] So I don't know what to do Claudia.
[14:49] Can try to see if I can find the people who give me the money.
[14:57] If that is not success I have to say something.
[15:02] With value here.
[15:09] I am trying to buy things for food.
[15:22] For me and the children, for example like yesterday.
[15:27] Another other day I was buying things because I know I have a limit because I am not working.
[15:40] So my credit card is supporting me.
[15:49] I am trying to do my best.
[15:52] I am studying and when I am in someone I am going to have the permission.
[16:01] I am going to go to the job center to try to find a job.
[16:10] I am on the way.
[16:32] I am studying English by myself and Danish by myself in the computer.
[16:39] I think I am doing the correct things on the way for all the steps.
[16:47] No, but I want to say that you are not alone.
[16:54] I am doing step by step for work too.
[17:01] We can't find a solution.
[17:08] I understand that you want to try to invest in this opportunity that you show me.
[17:16] But you haven't had money now for that.
[17:21] And I understand that you feel stressful for that.
[17:25] But what happens if someone gives you the money and you lose the money again?
[17:33] You are going to have to be more stressful because you are using a money for another person and you can lose that because it is a big risk.
[17:46] But in this end I will get the money from my mother.
[17:55] I know what you say.
[18:01] I am worried for that. But do you know about these things?
[18:07] I don't.
[18:13] It's very easy. If you are small with a little amount, you don't earn only a little.
[18:19] If you start with a big amount, you earn very quickly and you can take money out.
[18:26] That's how it is.
[18:32] The most important thing is to get started with as high amount as possible.
[19:03] I am going to make a coffee.
[19:09] I am going to make a coffee.
[19:16] I am going to make a coffee.
[19:24] I don't know if you understand me.
[19:30] I don't know if you respect my way of trying to analyze all and finally you have to analyze all.
[19:46] I try to analyze all and finally you have to take some decisions, some conclusions.
[19:59] You need to do something because sitting here drinking coffee, looking out the window is not a solution.
[20:10] What is your plan?
[20:14] I already told you.
[20:19] You are thinking maybe if you don't find the money for other person, you are thinking maybe sell something.
[20:30] I am already...
[20:37] Maybe I take the pictures after I am seen today and put it on marketplace.
[20:44] Because with this money, we can relax.
[20:53] I can start the invest.
[20:58] We can go up.
[21:08] If we go up, I can buy another machine.
[21:14] I don't want to get rid of the machine.
[21:25] But...
[21:29] You have another solution.
[21:33] If not in reality.
[21:38] If you analyze all the possibilities and you consider that it is the only way.
[21:45] I don't believe I can find work for the company and earn enough money.
[21:52] I don't believe.
[21:55] I tried this in some fucking hell many years ago.
[22:03] I tried to call to the man who would give you work.
[22:08] Maybe he has something.
[22:14] No, I will not.
[22:17] Okay.
[22:25] I will not.
[22:31] I will not.
[22:36] I will not.
[22:43] I will not.
[22:50] I will not.
[22:56] I will not.
[23:02] I will not.
[23:09] I will not.
[23:16] I will not.
[23:23] I will not.
[23:29] I will not.
[23:36] I will not.
[23:42] I will not.
[23:48] I will not.
[23:54] I will not.
[24:01] I will not.
[24:06] I will not.
[24:16] How much do you think that you can't get for this green machine?
[24:21] It depends on if I want to do the deal quickly or we have a little more time.
[24:31] Around 10,000 to 12,000 dollars.
[25:02] I don't know what to say because it's your machine.
[25:11] For other size you want to invest in this.
[25:18] The trading.
[25:24] I don't know that there are some risks.
[25:27] It's a very hard decision.
[25:31] If there was one here right now, we are 12,000 dollars.
[25:38] I say, go.
[25:45] That's my sister's.
[25:52] She says, it's only material things.
[25:57] Who said that?
[26:01] Lisa?
[26:08] Lisa?
[26:15] Lisa?
[26:22] Lisa?
[26:25] Please tell me how can I do to about my children's mobile phone?
[26:35] I don't know how your economy is.
[26:45] I don't know how much hands are supporting you with the club.
[26:49] But you know I pay 3000 kms to my children every month.
[27:00] Hands sent me first of all.
[27:06] His work is like an assistant.
[27:16] His salary is a few.
[27:23] He said that he can only pay around 800 kms.
[27:36] For both.
[27:39] Because we have another situation in my country.
[27:45] The salary is not the same of here.
[27:48] It's an other world.
[27:52] I try to do.
[27:59] But he said that he was trying to get some money for come to be easy to the children.
[28:10] But it's not going to be possible.
[28:13] So he decided to buy the ticket for the concert for José Carlos with this little money.
[28:21] And for go to Copenhagen.
[28:24] Because his reality.
[28:27] If you think that you have a bad situation, he is down.
[28:34] But I am thinking that when I will begin to work, it's going to be changed all.
[28:44] Because I'm going to have an economy and help.
[28:48] The situation is also, we are here now.
[28:58] I am put into a situation where I am economically responsible for five people.
[29:06] That is the reality.
[29:10] We talk a lot about this before travel.
[29:16] I know about the two children I have my own.
[29:19] Yes.
[29:20] It was a change in my situation.
[29:23] For the three-seater.
[29:24] And in the same time, I don't get the money from the local government for my own children.
[29:29] The support this way.
[29:30] I also lost those money as an income.
[29:34] So actually it's maybe three thousand a month.
[29:44] Five thousand a month.
[29:46] I lost.
[30:14] And I am very sad about all this.
[30:23] And I know inside me I feel shame and I feel a lot of shit.
[30:32] But what can I do?
[30:40] I don't know how it's the job here in Denmark.
[30:45] But if you go to the job center, do you have some possibilities?
[30:55] To go to the depth center for me is humiliating.
[31:01] Is what?
[31:02] Humiliating.
[31:03] Why?
[31:10] It's not easy to explain clearly.
[31:41] And the other side I could try to recall the bank and say blah blah blah.
[32:03] I am 99% sure what they will say.
[32:09] No.
[32:14] And even that makes the situation worse because then the bank will start knowing something.
[32:29] Okay.
[32:36] It's not a normal situation for me Claudia.
[33:01] I had many hard times in my life and fighting a little with the economy.
[33:08] But I always have the ability to use a little money.
[33:13] Save.
[33:15] Do a low budget.
[33:17] Do my own bread.
[33:20] Etc.
[33:24] And then with a little time I always arrived.
[33:29] Now rich.
[33:34] But I can't.
[33:36] This is not now.
[33:38] Now which going?
[33:41] Down.
[33:50] And yes, it is maybe my own fault.
[33:58] In many ways.
[34:28] And yes.
[34:35] And yes.
[34:42] And yes.
[34:49] And yes.
[34:56] And yes.
[35:03] And yes.
[35:10] So you need a little time to think about all this.
[35:29] And what do you think?
[35:39] No, I think that if you consider that you need to sell something, I am going to respect your decision.
[35:53] You... I...
[36:00] I understand you.
[36:04] This is a stressful situation and I'm sure that we are going to find a way.
[36:12] I'm not sure.
[36:16] I'm very, very, very afraid of coming here.
[36:24] I'm sad.
[36:27] I'm very sad.
[36:34] Mm-hmm.
[36:41] But then really I...
[36:53] What can I do? I only can stay with you and give you my emotional support.
[37:01] Because I can't do another thing.
[37:23] I'm not sure.
[37:30] I'm not sure.
[37:37] I'm not sure.
[37:44] But it's important that we can talk and we know what's going on and we can accept.
[38:08] Yes.
[38:11] Because I am accepting.
[38:13] Claudia, I have no energy left for fighting.
[38:17] Yes. And any... any is fighting.
[38:21] I'm very...
[38:26] I am in a situation as I...
[38:39] This is not a life for me.
[38:46] This is no life for me.
[38:59] And I don't want to be that person.
[39:11] For me and the people around me looking at me.
[39:17] I understand.
[39:21] People then run away from me.
[39:51] I understand.
[39:58] I understand.
[40:05] I understand.
[40:12] I understand.
[40:19] I understand.
[40:26] I understand.
